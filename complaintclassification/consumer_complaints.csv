The charges were reversed, but Regions Bank had to cancel my existing credit card and issue a new credit card. When they issued the new card, they canceled autopay without telling me about it. After the first late fee was assessed, I challenged the late fee on the grounds that they had canceled autopay without telling me. They reversed the late fee. I checked the account online to confirm autopay was active. It said it was. Yet, again, the next month autopay did not go through. I was charged another late fee. They would not remove this fee. I called to tell them that autopay was enabled. They said the online system was incorrect. They said you can not set up autopay online even though there is an option to set up autopay online. They said I would have to mail in a form to set up autopay. I mailed that form in XXXX. It is the end of XXXX and XXXX has still not gone through. I was charged another late fee despite having mailed an autopay authorization two months ago. Again, they will not remove this late fee."

Despite my repeated requests, Flagship Credit Acceptance has failed to disclose the following critical information : 1. **Notice of Sale** : The lender has not provided the required notice detailing the sale of the repossessed vehicle, including the sale price, as mandated by applicable state laws. 2. **GAP Insurance Credits** : I have requested information regarding any amounts credited from my Guaranteed Asset Protection ( GAP ) insurance that were applied towards the sale price of the vehicle and the remaining loan balance. This information is crucial for understanding my financial obligations following the repossession. Under California law, lenders are obligated to provide a detailed accounting of the sale of repossessed vehicles, including the sale price and any credits from GAP insurance [ [ 3 ] ] The lack of transparency in this matter not only violates my rights as a consumer but also undermines the regulatory framework designed to protect borrowers from unfair practices. I urge the CFPB to investigate this matter and take appropriate action to ensure that Flagship Credit Acceptance complies with its legal obligations. The failure to disclose this information is detrimental to my financial well-being and may constitute a violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act."

I filed a dispute and was issued credit for the item. Later Paypal charged my account an additional {$130.00} and put a restriction on my account. Mind you, I pay my bills monthly with them.

They do this to frustrate the consumer and try to steal your money! I am on the phone right now with PayPal credit and I am recording the call. She can't make heads or tail of what it is PayPal is doing. She's asking me what is Paypal doing? How am I supposed to know? If XXXX is an agent of Paypal, why am I saddled with trying to decipher what Paypal is doing? 
Paypal credit said they never gave me a credit twice but just once. They do not know what Paypal is saying, or doing. They only issued the credit once and not twice as the letter from Paypal is stating. 
This is so frustrating."

Mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Paying off the loan,"Complaint Against Bank of America for Breach of Trust, Contract, and Fraudulent Practices To the Attorney General Offices of Florida : I am submitting this formal complaint to address Bank of Americas fraudulent practices, breach of trust, and deliberate mismanagement of my mortgage loan. These actions have resulted in significant financial loss, mental distress, and long-term harm to my familys stability. My mortgage, originally with a remaining balance of {$17000.00}, was improperly handled in ways that reveal a pattern of predatory intent under the guise of industry standards.

Key Issues in My Complaint : 1. Unauthorized Placement in Forbearance : In early XXXX, anticipating financial strain from my military duties during the COVID-19 pandemic, I requested a refinance for my home loan. Instead, Bank of America placed my loan into forbearance without my consent or proper explanation. My efforts to reverse this unauthorized action were met with absolute refusals, with representatives stating that the decision was irreversible. When I continued to question this action, I was repeatedly dismissed and told that it was industry standard. 

2. Mishandling of Loan Transfers : While the forbearance issue remained unresolved, Bank of America transferred my loan to XXXXXXXX and later to XXXX XXXX. XXXX has since ceased operations, leaving me unable to access vital documentation of payments made under their servicing. Bank of America failed to ensure that I had a complete record of my loan history before this transfer, severely compromising my ability to manage my mortgage. 

3. Financial and Emotional Harm : This ordeal has caused profound financial damage and stress. Due to the unauthorized forbearance, the extra payments I had made during my active military service were rendered useless. Navigating the confusing and deliberately obstructive responses from Bank of America has exacerbated the challenges of providing for my family post-COVID. The systemic failures and dismissive responses have eroded my financial security and caused immeasurable mental anguish. 

Historical Misconduct by Bank of America XXXX Bank of America has a documented history of predatory and fraudulent practices targeting homeowners, evidenced by penalties and legal actions : XXXX DOJ Settlement : The bank agreed to a {$16.00} XXXX settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice for mortgage fraud, including misrepresenting loan quality and selling defective loans to consumers and investors. 
COVID-19 Forbearance Issues : Numerous consumer complaints reveal that Bank of America improperly placed mortgages into forbearance without borrower consent during the pandemic, further harming financially vulnerable customers.

Ongoing Allegations : Despite past penalties, Bank of America continues to face widespread allegations of mismanagement, deceptive practices, and failure to communicate effectively with borrowers. 
These actions demonstrate a systemic pattern of exploitation, perpetuated despite previous accountability measures. 

Requested Resolutions : To address the extensive harm caused, I request the following actions : Restoration of Loan Terms : Reverse the unauthorized forbearance and restore my loan to its original terms, reflecting the accurate remaining balance of {$17000.00}. 
Comprehensive Documentation : Provide all payment records, loan activity, and detailed explanations of adjustments made during Bank of Americas servicing and subsequent transfers.

Integration of Deferred Balances : Consolidate any deferred amounts into a transparent, structured payment plan, ensuring future payment discrepancies are avoided.

Independent Audit and Accountability : Conduct a third-party review of my mortgage account for violations of consumer protection laws, including the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ). 
Substantial Financial Compensation : Monetary Damages : Restitution for financial losses, lost payments, and inflated fees caused by Bank of Americas unauthorized actions.

Punitive Damages : Compensation that reflects the gravity of their repeated misconduct and failure to address systemic issues.

Interest and Legal Fees : Reimbursement for accrued interest and costs incurred in resolving this matter.

Emotional Distress Compensation : Recognition of the severe mental and emotional harm inflicted on me and my family due to these practices. 
Closing Statement : As a veteran who has proudly served my country, I expect institutions entrusted with financial stewardship to operate with integrity. Instead, Bank of America has engaged in practices that exploit its customers, leveraging systemic vulnerabilities under the guise of standard practice.

I respectfully urge the Attorney Generals office to thoroughly investigate these practices and hold Bank of America accountable for their actions. My case represents one of many instances where the institution has harmed homeowners through deceptive means. The resolution of this complaint will not only provide justice for my family but also safeguard countless others from enduring similar harm.

In short : I was close to paying off my loan, but Bank of America placed me on forebearance and sold my loan to another company because it was an : "" Industry Standard ''. Not sure what that means, but the outcome as a homeowner has only proved negative. 

I have tried to resolve the problem by myself, as I consult with an escalation expert from Bank of America, with them telling : There's nothing we can do, it is not our problem anymore, go talk with your new servicer, by whom is owned by XXXX XXXX as an investment property, but uses servicing from XXXX XXXX, whom are not recognized within the mortgage industry."

Consequently, I am formally requesting that these accounts be blocked and removed from my report immediately. 

It is important to clarify that this request is not due to any error or negligence on my part. There has been no oversight or misunderstanding on my end. Instead, this issue arises solely from the fact that I did not explicitly authorize the inclusion of these transactions in my report. I am diligent about maintaining the accuracy and privacy of my financial records, and these unauthorized entries compromise that integrity. 

I trust that you will handle this matter with the urgency and seriousness it deserves. Please confirm the removal of these transactions from my report as soon as possible. Thank you for your prompt attention to this issue."
"Payday loan, title loan, personal loan, or advance loan",Getting the loan,None,"In XX/XX/year>, I received a fraudulent call pretending to be from Affirm, asking for my account PIN. I immediately reported this to Affirm, and my account was placed on hold to prevent any fraudulent activity. 

On XX/XX/year>, I attempted to make a purchase using Affirm but was declined because Affirm could not confirm my identity. I contacted Affirm daily through chat and phone from XX/XX/year>, to XX/XX/year>, to resolve this issue and reactivate my account. Each time, I was informed that my case would be escalated and resolved within XXXX business days. However, the issue remains unresolved, and my account is still frozen. 

On XX/XX/year>, I was informed by Affirm that my Shop Pay account information does not match my Affirm account due to my Shop Pay account being associated with my previous name and email. To address this issue, I : Contacted XXXX XXXX daily from XX/XX/year>, to XX/XX/year>, to request the deletion of the outdated account. 
Used Shop Pays account deletion process multiple times, but the outdated account still exists. 
Created a new XXXX XXXX account under my updated legal name and contact details. 
Provided Affirm with proof of identity as requested to reflect my updated name. 
Affirm successfully updated my legal name on the account after verifying my identity, but they will not allow me to verify my identity to unfreeze my account. This inconsistency has prevented me from resolving the hold and using my account. 

Additionally, the loan number in this complaint is for a successful loan from before these issues began. Declinations do not come with loan numbers, so I used this loan number to help Affirm locate my account and resolve the issue. 

Despite my repeated efforts with both companies, including multiple verification attempts, my Affirm account remains frozen, and XXXX XXXX has not confirmed the deletion of the outdated account. These issues continue to prevent me from making purchases or using XXXX XXXX Installments effectively."
Credit card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"I opened a Capital One Venture XXXX  credit card based on their advertised robust travel services, which they provide through the Capital One XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/year>, I booked a XXXX XXXX ticket for {$110.00} through this portal for travel on XX/XX/year>. I later rescheduled the ticket to XX/XX/year> through the same platform. Capital One XXXX did not inform me of penalties or fees tied to cancellations or rescheduling. 

Following this, I decided to cancel the ticket through Capital One XXXX today ( XXXX, 2024 ), as I was assured by the platform interface that XXXX would provide an airline credit worth the ticket price to my account for future use. However, when I tried to utilize this airline credit, Capital One XXXX informed me of a {$99.00} penalty being imposed on my account, allegedly on behalf of XXXX, because of the cancellation. This penalty was not communicated to me when I rescheduled or canceled the ticket. 

I reached out to Capital One XXXX via customer hotline to resolve the issue, pointing out their lack of transparency, but they refused to take responsibility, instead directing me to contact XXXX XXXX. XXXX, in turn, stated that since the ticket was booked through a third-party agency, any concerns should be addressed with Capital One XXXX XXXX 

I was shocked by this response and felt trapped in a situation where neither party was willing to provide clarity or resolution. Upon further research, I discovered that many customers have encountered similar problems with Capital One XXXX. It seems that customers are lured into opening credit cards like the Venture XXXX, which has a {$390.00} annual fee, with promises of robust travel support, only to face poor service and hidden penalties when utilizing these advertised benefits. 

This lack of transparency, combined with the failure to disclose material terms about penalties, feels deceptive and exploitative. If I had been informed about the {$99.00} penalty upfront, I would not have proceeded with the rescheduling or cancellation. 

I am requesting that the {$99.00} penalty be removed from my account, as it was never disclosed during the transaction. Additionally, I hope that the CFPB can look into Capital One XXXX 's practices and advertisements for systemic issues that might be harming customers in similar ways. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter."

Subject : Complaint Against Hayt, Hayt & Landau P.L., Represented by Attorney XXXX XXXX I am filing this formal complaint against the Law Offices of Hayt, Hayt & Landau P.L., represented by Attorney XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, GA XXXX, for unethical practices, including filing false documents in court and violating privacy protection laws. 

Summary of Complaint : 1. Filing False Affidavits : In a sworn affidavit submitted to the court, Hayt, Hayt & Landau claimed I was served court case documents at a location that i had intended to built a home but never built or lived on. The address cited in the affidavit is vacant land with no structure and has never been inhabited. I do not reside there nor have I ever received any service at that location. 

The affidavit also alleges that a neighbora "" white male between XXXX, '' unknown to meconfirmed my identity. This raises serious concerns regarding the falsification of information, as I have no association with any neighbor at the described location, and it appears my private details were improperly disclosed. 

XXXX. Violation of Privacy Protection Laws : The affidavit indicates that my personal information was discussed with a purported "" neighbor '' without my consent. This constitutes a violation of federal and state privacy laws, such as the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), which prohibits the disclosure of personal information to third parties. 

3. Misrepresentation and Lack of Transparency : At the time of this complaint, I have not been provided any direct information about the case despite multiple inquiries. I only became aware of this matter through calls from attorneys marketing their services and details obtained from the court clerk. 

XXXX. Evidence of Absence : In XX/XX/year>, I left out of the country for a family emergency and traveled via XXXX XXXX. This can be easily verified and serves as proof that I was not in the location they claim to have served me. 


Applicable Laws Violated : 1. Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : Section 807 ( 10 ) : Prohibits the use of false or deceptive means to collect a debt.

Section 805 ( b ) : Prohibits the communication of personal information to third parties without consent.

2. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ( Rule 4 ) : Requires service of process to be completed at the correct address and prohibits the submission of false affidavits of service. 


XXXX. State Laws on False Affidavits and Privacy Violations : Georgia law ( O.C.G.A. XXXX ) : Criminalizes filing false statements or documents in court. 


Impact : Filing false documents and violating privacy laws denies me the rights to a fair trial, undermine the sanctity of the court and consumer protection rights. Attorneys and law firms must be held to the highest standards of legal ethics, ensuring accuracy and compliance with applicable laws. 

Relief Sought : 1. Immediate investigation into the practices of Hayt, Hayt & Landau P.L. and Attorney XXXX XXXX. 


XXXX. Sanctions against the firm and attorney for filing false affidavits. 


XXXX. Compensation for damages caused by privacy violations and the distress caused by their unethical practices.

Mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,"I am nearing the end of my XXXX XXXXXXXX bankruptcy and was advised by my lawyer that I do a full accounting of how the payments were applied to my account by my mortgage servicer ( Fay Servicing ), so 3 months ago I requested a full ledger of all my payments & escrow payments ( since XXXX ) and how they have been applied. 
The first time I requested it they sent me a partial ledger where the running balance columns were missing. I have since requested a full ledger, with all of the columns visible, three times. These requests were spaced out over several weeks ; they said they were going to send them each time but they never did. 
The last phone call request I made was a few weeks ago and the representative hung up on me so I called them back and recorded the call which I will attach to this request. 
During this period the total amount due, as printed on the monthly statements Fay Servicing has mailed to me has fluctuated by almost {$200000.00} : XXXX {$73000.00} XXXX {$86000.00} XXXX {$6400.00} XXXX {$200000.00} Since these numbers are supposed to come from the underlying account ledger, its clear that they are making adjustments.

This payment was supposed to be applied as {$2400.00} toward the principal and interest and the balance was supposed to be applied to escrow on my current taxes in accordance with my mortgage agreement, but they stopped paying my property taxes and then tried to use my resulting property tax delinquency in support of their foreclosure. 
The judge ruled in my favor but it cost me {$34000.00} in lawyer fees to fight it and obtain this ruling."

I wanted to sell my condo when I became ill and was XXXX weeks behind in my mortgage payments. I asked my ex-husband to help. XXXX. My ex looked at my loan applications which were submitted on my behalf by my landlord at a time ( who has been a long time condo board member and licensed realtor ). He discovered that my condo address was changed during the loan origination by the seller entering a new building number for my condo. My title report was forged and it was not shown that there is a mortgage on whole building and land, and open mortgage from the former owner on the condo unit which I was buying in the building.

I notified the mortgage servicer on XX/XX/XXXX about the fraud and sent evidence of fraudulent loan applications and changed property address. XXXX. Mortgage servicer, instead of putting me in a nonmonetary default for fraud in the borrower 's application, as it is required in my mortgage contract, waited until I am eligible for a monetary default for failure to make mortgage payments, and started the foreclosure proceedings then.

Vehicle loan or lease,Problems at the end of the loan or lease,Problem extending the lease,"I am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction with Ally Financials handling of my lease extension request, which has resulted in unexpected daily fees and significant inconvenience. The sequence of events demonstrates poor communication and a lack of transparency, leading to what I believe are unfair charges.

Background I requested a 30-day lease extension to address repairs for a recalled part on my vehicle. Based on my interactions with Ally representatives, I believed that the lease extension had been approved.

However, I was surprised to receive a call from Ally weeks later, asking for the vehicles return. This was the first indication I had that my extension request had been denied.

Without any notification or explanation of the denial, I was subsequently charged daily extension fees, which I had not agreed to and were applied without my knowledge or consent.

Issues Lack of Notification on Lease Extension Denial I was not informed that my request for a 30-day lease extension was denied. This lapse in communication led me to believe that the extension was in place, causing confusion and financial repercussions when additional fees were charged.

Unfair and Unexpected Fees After learning of the denied extension, I was charged daily extension fees retroactively. These fees are unreasonable given that I acted in good faith, believing the extension had been approved.

Poor Customer Communication Allys failure to clearly communicate the status of my request left me blindsided by the charges and disrupted my ability to plan accordingly. This reflects a lack of transparency and customer care."

Credit card,"Advertising and marketing, including promotional offers",Didn't receive advertised or promotional terms,"In XX/XX/XXXX, after much research on our best options for a new CC, my husband and I opened a Chase Freedom Unlimited credit card which was supposed to include a {$250.00} sign up bonus after spending {$500.00} in the first 3 months. We have spent well over {$500.00} and have never seen the expected {$250.00} bonus - not in the form of a statement credit, and not in the form of points added to our balance on the card. 

Our first purchase was made on XX/XX/XXXX, and now that we are past the 90 days mark since that initial transaction occurred, I reached out to Chase on their "" secure message '' feature on the website to inquire when we should expect the funds. I was told that we were never to receive them, that the only sign up perk on this card was 1.5 % additional earnings on all spends up to $ XXXX in the first 12 months. 

I replied back and advised that this was meant to be IN ADDITION to the {$250.00} sign up bonus when we applied... when we signed up we were promised the same bonus that is currently being extended - screen shots attached for reference. 

I replied again advising this is incorrect and that the whole reason we chose the Chase Freedom card was because they were extending an offer for both {$250.00} AND the 1.5 % additional earnings .... They replied again today accusing me of trying to get a "" richer offer '' and saying that the only offer extended to me is the 1.5 % additional earnings offer. 
I have looked into this online and found MULTIPLE members complaining of the same experience with Chase when signing up for a new card and then not receiving the bonus that was originally offered on the promotion at the time they applied for their credit card through Chase. I let Chase bank know in my most recent message response that I would be contacting the CFPB to help spread awareness so that future members do not find themselves in this same position."

"Payday loan, title loan, personal loan, or advance loan",Problem when making payments,None,"I am writing to file a formal complaint against Three Sticks Lending for their unfair lending practices and refusal to revoke a pending payment. Below are the details of my experience : Company Name : Three Sticks Lending Loan Amount : {$1000.00} APR : XXXX XXXX  ( Significantly higher than the legal limit in XXXX  ) State : XXXX XXXX : I took out a loan with this tribal lending company, but upon reviewing the terms, I discovered that the APR is far higher than what is legally allowed in my state ( XXXX  ). When I raised this issue, the company argued that tribal sovereignty exempted them from my state 's interest rate laws. I informed them that various court cases have ruled against tribal lenders for charging exorbitant rates. They softened, said they could "" help me '' but not as low as I asked. They insisted that they could not lower the APR to XXXX XXXX the legal limit for XXXX. 

Pending Payment Dispute : On XX/XX/year>, I authorized an early payment of {$280.00} for this loan. However, later I attempted to revoke this pending payment as I felt I was being misled by the company 's policies and it was required to change my APR.

I was told that I could not revoke the pending payment, and that the payment had to clear before they could make any changes to the loan terms or APR.

I requested that they cancel the pending payment. Initially, I was informed by multiple employees that they could not revoke a pending payment. When asking what sort of system did not allow for cancelling pending payments, they would not give me a lucid reason. Multiple people said "" the computer won't let it '' or "" the system won't allow it. '' They would not tell me what sort of software prevented them from cancelling the pending payment, and Eventually, someone helped me remove ACH access. However, I later found out that revoking a pending payment is not only possible but legally required under certain conditions. 

I was transferred to a supervisor, who continued to insist that it was "" not possible '' to revoke a payment while it was pending, and that I had "" authorized it '' despite my insistence and legal understanding of the matter ; and the insistence that I was revoking said authorization, since the payment was still pending. This supervisor, named XXXX told me that they could post a refund form, but protested to me asking if it would "" probably '' go through. I am concerned they will make no attempt to refund me either, once the payment goes through. Near the end of the phone call, she began making ad hominem attacks about how it was "" on me '' that I had a loan, and that I was "" looking for loopholes '' and "" expecting them to drop everything to fix it. '' She told me that the kind of system they were using to make the payments was "" not relevant '' when I asked her, which makes it clear to me that they could revoke the pending payment. A woman later said it was "" the rules '' and that she couldn't cancel my pending payment. 

It says this on the loan agreement ; "" if your scheduled payment has already been submitted to your financial institution at the time of revocation, it may be necessary for us to wait until that payment posts before we can refund you that payment amount. However, when possible, at the time of revocation, we will void any pending payments. You understand that revoking your authorization does not relieve you of the responsibility of timely paying all amounts due in full that are owed by you under the Agreement. '' It seems to me that they made no good faith attempt to stop the payment, insisting it was impossible.

As of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ; "" Regulation E ( 12 CFR 1005.10 ( b ) ) : ( b ) ( 2 ) : If a scheduled preauthorized transfer has already been submitted for processing, the financial institution is not required to stop the transfer, but it must make reasonable efforts to do so
. '' The APR charged by the company is predatory and violates state laws. I do not believe they operate in good faith, and I believe they were dishonest to me.

I believe the company has misled me regarding their ability to revoke a pending payment, potentially violating legal requirements for consumers to have the ability to revoke authorization for a pending payment. The company 's refusal to change the APR or revoke a pending payment is a violation of consumer rights and possibly indicative of poor business practices or lack of knowledge on how to use their payment system."

Credit card,Trouble using your card,Can't use card to make purchases,"On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX ; XXXX, I pre-applied, was approved then lifted my credit freezes and applied and was approved for a Capital One Unsecured Quicksilver Cash Back, No Annual Fee Credit Card with the PROMOTIONAL {$200.00} bonus for spending {$500.00} in the first 3 months. Capital One immediately mailed out the Quicksilver Credit Card with a FRAUD "" Restriction '' placed on the card unbeknownst to me. Once I finally received the card, I attempted to activate the card online but was immediately forwarded to Capital One 's Fraud Dept, supposedly for verification of my identity and address. The Fraud Dept attempted to send a code to your cellphone listed when I applied for you to accept to complete activation, however this process did not work obviously, Capital One has "" RESTRICTED '' the card any account attached to it. SO I can not activate the card. 

Next, Capital One 's Fraud dept emailed me a link to upload the following documents/items to prove my identity and prove my address : XXXX. ) The Front and Back of my Drivers License, which MIUST match the address you used to apply for your Capital One card, I submitted that easily and that documentation was accepted **This documentation should have been enough to complete Identity and address but Capital would not activate the card. ** XXXX. ) Upload a Utility bill OR If you don't have utility bills in your name ( which I don't ), you can upload an internet bill. Both bills must show your name, address you used to apply for your Capital One Card, FULL account number and billing must be within the past 10 days. 
**I am a prepaid customer ( XXXX for 14 years ) and PREPAY does not receive a bill. However, XXXX Customer Service emailed confirmation of my cellphone and home internet account with name, address, account number and active status. CAPITAL ONE REJECTED THE DOCUMENTATION because it was not a bill** XXXX. ) Upload my ENTIRE Bank Statement including ALL pages with my account activity OR The Bank Summary page with Name, Address, Account Numbers of ALL your accounts + to supplement the Bank Summary I need to submit a voided check, Deposit slip or a Withdrawal slip from my checkbook register, provided you have a checking account. 
** For privacy purposes, I chose to submit my Bank Summary Page with all of the aforementioned necessary information. I have a checking account but do not have checks as I use my debit card or cash, hence no check to void and no Deposit/Withdrawal slips. I did however do business with a check cashing institution that drafted a check for payment and that check cleared my bank account. I submitted that cleared check front and back to supplement my Account Summary. Capital One Fraud Dept. rejected my submission because my Account Summary shows the last 4 of my account numbers for SECURITY PUROSES and the Fraud Dept simply refused to accept the cleared check as evidence of my address. After speaking with another Fraud Agent, I was advised to have the bank submit on their letterhead all the information confirming my account with my name, address, full account number and if my account was active. I uploaded that documentation from the XXXXXXXX XXXX Branch Manager with return phone number, fax number and email on XXXXXXXX XXXX letterhead as instructed. My submission was again rejected by Capital One 's Fraud dept. ** I went thru this Identification process with various Capital One Fraud Dept reps all whom rejected my documentation for various reasons from XX/XX/XXXX until today XX/XX/XXXX. When I asked to speak to a manager, I asked why the card was deemed FRAUD and why was it "" RESTRICTED ''. The Fraud Dept reps and Managers told me "" We can not say to disclose why. ' I the asked if they could mail me the reason why and again I was denied the courtesy of a reason via mail. 

Due to Capital One placing a FRAUD "" RESTRICTION '' on the Quicksilver Credit Card and account, I can no longer access the CreditWise Credit Monitoring that I have had an account with for 11 years ( since 2013 ) due to an information breach in 2012. So now I am effectively "" Restricted : from activating the credit card that I qualified for and I am locked out of a credit monitoring service of which I had an account of 11 years and Capital One verified my identity 11 years ago when I was offered the Credit Monitoring Account. 

Lastly, on XX/XX/XXXX. I received an alert from XXXX notifying me of a new credit card account on my credit file. I login and Capital One has the audacity to report the "" Restricted '' Quicksilver Credit Card and "" RESTRICTED '' Capital One Account that I have no access to use as an ACTIVE credit card account. That act by Capital One is FRAUDULENT and ILLEGAL!! Needless to say, my credit score took a hit and dropped some points due to this "" NEW CREDIT CARD '' reported by Capital One in my credit file. Immediately filed a DISPUTE with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I immediately called Capital One 's Fraud Dept the next day to file an internal complaint about this abuse of my documentation, my identity and my credit file on today, XX/XX/XXXX. This process and the constant gaslighting, moving the goal post, changing the rules and rejecting the documents that Capital One themselves asked for is FINANCIAL ABUSE and DISCRIMINATION as I a few of my friends whom recommended me to apply with Capital One have applied for Capital One cards in the past XXXX weeks and NEVER went thru the process of what I went through to activate their cards. Then for Capital One to commit FRAUD themselves on my XXXX Credit Report File is the accuser victimizing the victim. Sounds a lot like AI is running Capital One due to the inflexibility, inhumanity and fraudulent activities! 

As a note, I asked Capital One Fraud Department Managers and Reps to file my internal complaints about he process and locking me out of my CreditWise Credit Monitoring Account on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and on XX/XX/XXXX adding to the complaint of the fraudulent reporting of a "" RESTRICTED '' Capital One credit card and account on my XXXX Credit File."

Using WFs own response stating that I owed {$190.00} on XX/XX/year> and paid {$260.00} on XX/XX/XXXX after having to track them down to find payment information they failed to provide or digital notifications they promised, I would still have overpaid them by {$70.00} on XX/XX/XXXX which more than covers any {$29.00} fee and would have brought the account current ( and overpaid by {$41.00} assuming the fee remained ). Their own document then contradicts itself on the following line stating that {$260.00} was past due between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX while it earlier stated a minimum payment of {$190.00} was all that was due XX/XX/XXXX. Incompetence and deceptive practices has been my experience from Wells Fargo on each attempt to resolve this issue.

My expectation remains the removal of all late fees and correctly adjusting my account to reflect good standing and accurate payment history throughout. As a gesture of good faith, I will not seek a refund of {$70.00} ( or {$41.00} assuming the {$29.00} fee ) as a result of the stated overpayment on the document they provided."

The one representative sent me an email link to submit the documents however, a document was posted XX/XX/XXXX stating the dispute was closed and capital one was unwilling to reconsider the dispute because we did not submit documents any timely manner.

I later learned capital one has an incorrect email on file however I'm not entirely sure what the email is as the representative would not share the email with me and would only verify that it is not my father 's email. We have since updated it however I feel due to the lack of proper notification and the fact that the customer service representative who took the initial dispute, did not verify accuracy of information they have on file, Capitol One should have accepted the additional documentation provided for fair consideration. Representatives have told me they would escalate my concerns and reach back out to advise and this has not happened. I feel we have been treated very unfairly as well as very poorly."

After years of litigation, we were finally set to go to trial, but fortunately, we settled out of court on XXXX, XXXX 

Since then, Ive submitted all the required documentation to process my claim, including information about the settlement payment, which was made on XX/XX/2024. However, as of today, XX/XX/XXXX, Ive been making multiple calls to Mr.Cooper Loss Draft Depart to inquire about the status of my payment and to ensure there are no further delays. Ive also asked about any additional documentation they might need to avoid further complications. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I was informed that I needed to submit an estimate from the insurance adjuster, which I did. The estimate was for {$13000.00}. However, XXXX, the supervisor I spoke to, told me that they couldnt accept the estimate because my settlement amount is {$120000.00}. I explained that the payment we received was a result of the insurance company breaching their contract in bad faith. Despite this, XXXX insisted that I resubmit a line-item breakdown of the contractors bid, even though the original submission included the total amount. 

I also spoke with XXXX XXXX, who apologized for the delays and assured me that she would try to expedite my check. She understood the urgency of the situation, especially since my family and I have been suffering health issues due to the damage from the cast iron pipes. XXXX later informed me that she had managed to secure a XXXX  % release of the payment. However, I was then told in the evening that my second mortgage lender had endorsed the check incorrectly, and as a result, they would likely send it back to me for a re-endorsement. 

At this point, I am unable to make any progress on repairing my home without receiving these funds. The ongoing delays and confusion are causing significant hardship, and its becoming increasingly difficult to convey to others that I can not move forward without this payment."
Mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","Fay servicing has escrowed this account. They have been either late or failed to make payments on the Property Insurance and taxes repeatedly over the last few years. 

Further, they have refused to remove escrow from the loan despite not making these payments. 

Recently, this resulted in a lapse on my homeowners insurance subjecting my family and I to substantial liability. If we had lost our home during that time to a disaster, we would have been on the hook for a mortgage and homeless. 

I had to buy a separate policy out of my own pocket to cover the house. Despite this, I continue to have to make escrow payments on an account where the escrow money is not being paid out."

I called the customer service number on my card and the department was closed ( it was after XXXX XXXX XXXX ). I called when customer service was open on XX/XX/XXXX to explain that I was unable to access the site online and requested assistance with the website and my log in ; I made a telephone payment with the customer service agent and then waited on hold to be transferred to a department who could apparently help with the online access. I sat on hold until the line disconnected. In addition, I asked this agent what time of day my payment needed to be made on my due date as often there are cut off times ; I was advised that I can make my payment anytime before the due date ends ( I assume is XXXX XXXX  ), I asked her a second time to confirm, and she confirmed no specific cut off time for payments.

I then called the customer service number again and asked for help accessing my account ; I was asked by the XXXX agent how I was accessing the site and I advised I was using my XXXX  XXXX with both a safari browser and brave browser. She stated that the site does not work with XXXX products well nor the Brave browser. I advised this was my only point of access ( no computer ) and she said she could not advise how else to fix the issue. I also made a payment with this CS rep for XXXX and asked for a refund of late fees based on these access issues and was advised they could only refund {$15.00}, which they did. 
Now comes my XXXX payment, which I again attempted to use the NEW Big Lots app that I was able to download form the XXXX XXXX. The Big Lots/Comenity card now was accessible via this application. I again tried to register, tried to access my password for an account already created and nothing would work, the app would not send me any verification emails or PW reset emails. 
It appears that Comenity intentionally makes the ability to access payment mechanisms for the credit cards they service difficult and nearly impossible in order to drive profit from late fees."

What about the {$87.00} that Im due as a credit since the card is closed. I was told that XXXX checks would arrive. The security deposit refund could take up to XXXX weeks. I recd the {$87.00} separately b/c it would be coming from a different dept. I still have not recd the initial security deposit refund that multiple supervisors have stated I am due. I was told that as recently as XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX to expect my security deposit refund soon because that came from a different department. Today, XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to a different supervisor named XXXX. He confirmed that I am still owe the $ XXXX {$150.00} security deposit refund. He placed me on hold and he returned and then said matter fact, youre not doing any more refunds from us. So I would say about XXXX  % of the supervisors see that XXXX due this refund in about XXXX  % of the supervisors that I speak with do not see that Im owed this refund. This company is completely unethical and does not know the definition of Customer Service whatsoever depending on who you talk to depends on the answer that you get, but Im still waiting more than XXXX weeks later for my refund for my security deposit and the amount of $ XXXX {$150.00}. If the bank determines that there is not a refund due, I would like for them to provide me with the documentation showing specifically how they got to that conclusion where 70 % of the other supervisors have concluded otherwise. XXXX is to escalate for me to upper management that they review the call from XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX. When I canceled my account it was promised the refunds in XXXX separate checks. I was guaranteed that within XXXX to XXXX  days a XXXX will be calling me to discuss with me my concerns but not necessarily the outcome of what they heard from that call on XX/XX/XXXX. I am no full as Ive worked in law before and they are required to maintain all records financially for XXXX years, who I speak with when I speak to them and what we speak about I want to have that information. It is that information that holds the answer and the truth that Im owed this refund but they are withholding that from me."

Despite my repeated requests for debt validation, I have yet to receive any documentation to substantiate this claim. 

On XX/XX/year>, I sent a debt validation letter to AllianceOne, clearly outlining my request for proof of the alleged debt. As per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, I understand that I am entitled to this documentation, and it is unacceptable that they have not responded with any supporting evidence. 

The lack of communication and failure to provide the requested validation not only raises serious concerns about the legitimacy of this debt but also reflects poorly on the company 's business practices. I believe that they are attempting to collect a debt without the necessary legal backing, which is both unethical and frustrating. 

As of today, I am not inclined to pay this amount until I receive the proper documentation that confirms I owe this debt. I request your assistance in resolving this matter and urge you to hold AllianceOne accountable for their lack of responsiveness and transparency."

The total value of the warranty was 2 more years at {$820.00} which I requested to be applied to my ALLY account as a payment. XXXX then sent the funds over to ALLY the same day and they were in fact applied as a payment on XX/XX/XXXX for the monthly installment date of XX/XX/XXXX, which covered the payment for the month of XXXX. 

The website showed the next payment was due XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$140.00}. I checked my account as recently as Saturday XXXX XXXX2024 and the money transferred from XXXX was still applied as a monthly payment. ALLY decided more than 2 weeks from XXXX XXXX,2024 to then decide to reallocate the funds and remove it as a car payment and only apply it to reduce the total amount of the loan, however everytime I make a monthly payment it reduces the amount of the loan. 

They decided to once again use predatory lending practices to try and put my account into default so they can repossess my vehicle. This has been an ongoing issue and I am not the only ALLY customer who is experiencing these predatory lending practices but I may be one of the few who actually screenshot every payment and always screenshot the status of my account due to my XXXX and distrust of the company. They stated they will file an application to reallocate the funds but I dont believe them ( case # XXXX ). 

They still have YET to review the call from my previous complaint dated XXXX XXXX2024. They keep telling me a supervisor will reach out in the hopes that I forget about it but I wont and hope someone will intervene on my behalf as a consumer.

As part of the loan, SoFi was responsible for disbursing {$11000.00} to pay off a specified credit card account. However, due to an error, the funds were directed to an incorrect account, identified as a XXXX XXXX credit card instead of the intended XXXX XXXX credit card. 

Timeline of events : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  : I signed the loan agreement with SoFi, which included specific instructions to allocate {$11000.00} to the XXXX XXXX credit card account. Instead, SoFi 's records incorrectly identified this account as a XXXX XXXX credit card. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX : Upon reviewing the documentation and recognizing the error, I contacted SoFis customer service immediately to rectify the issue. I informed them that the funds needed to be directed to the correct XXXX XXXX credit card account instead of the XXXX XXXX account. 

XXXXResponse from SoFi : I was told by SoFi representatives that no corrective action could be taken until two weeks had passed. Despite my immediate efforts to clarify the situation, SoFi failed to address the matter promptly. 

XXXXSubsequent Follow-Up : Over the next several weeks and months, I followed up with SoFi to resolve the issue and confirm the funds were correctly redirected to the XXXX XXXX credit card account. However, no corrective action was taken, and to date, the intended recipient, the XXXX XXXX credit card issuer, has not received the funds. 

Actions I took : XXXXContacted SoFis customer service the following business day to report the error and request immediate action to resolve it. 

XXXXFollowed up with SoFi multiple times in the weeks following to demand clarification and a resolution. 

XXXXVerified with the XXXX XXXX credit card issuer that the payment was not received. 

Impact of SoFis actions : SoFi 's delay and lack of resolution have caused significant financial inconvenience and potential damage to my credit standing. Despite my proactive efforts to address the issue immediately after it was identified, SoFi has not fulfilled their contractual obligation to disburse the funds correctly or within a reasonable timeframe. 

I am seeking CFPB 's assistance in holding SoFi accountable for their failure to resolve this issue promptly and in ensuring that the funds are disbursed to the correct account."

If you were committed to fixing the errors you have caused, you certainly have had the time. This issue started after you failed to extend my Forbearance an additional 3 months, XXXX XXXX, till XXXX of XXXX under the Cares Act. You have had since then to reconcile all mistakes made by your team and adjust ALL balances and PAYMENTS as requested and required to bring the account in balance. You are in ERROR in stating that I transitioned from a Forbearance program and into a Deferral program on XX/XX/XXXX. Again, your representative STATED that a program did exist and that I could quality for a debt reduction and well as a possible interest rate reduction, however, I was under the FULL understanding and mindset to pursue an additional 3 Month Forbearance Extension, as it was MY RIGHT to do so under the Cares Act until XXXX of XXXX, and NOT to pursue and agree to alternative programs suggested by your representatives that would negate or override the rights to the already Enrolled Forbearance program. Any mistakes in communication were on You as a Bank as well as the Representatives that represent your Bank and the options and program details available for that program. Clearly, you have not fulfilled those obligations. If you have PROOF of me verbally, or in writing, accepting with full awareness and details of an alternative program to the Forbearance Program under the Cares Act, you are hereby being DEMANDED to provide LEGAL IRREFUTABLE PROOF of it as well as PROOF that I understood what I was agreeing to and the process that would unfold under that program.

You are Again, being DEMANDED to : 1 ) Adjust ALL PAYMENTS to PAID ON TIME, as I have clearly provided INDISPUTATIVE proof of. 2 ) Remove any NEGATIVE erroneous reporting that you have initiated to the Credit Bureaus. 3 ) You have also been sent an invoice bill that is to be paid immediately, for fraudulent charges, fees, and recovery amounts for the lengthy errors and mistakes that have been made by your bank. I suggest you take this matter seriously!! If there is not an equitable REAL relief to this matter, I will continue to adjust for further recovery & suffering of this matter. Please keep in mind that it is my belief, that this is a FAIR remedy that will be much more inexpensive on you should I pursue other Legal methods for Recovery. 


XX/XX/XXXX FACTS. 

1 ) I am DEMANDING PROOF of the Calls made to United Community Bank concerning my request for a FORBEARANCE EXTENTION under the Cares act in XXXX. You have failed to acknowledge this request or address it. If you are standing by what your claims are then PROVE IT!! Sending me paperwork for what I already know ; an initial Forbearance Request in XXXX, and not the follow-up request or proof that it did not exist as I have requested numerous times is simply avoiding your responsibility to that request. A call was made to you requesting the Forbearance Extension ( Recorded ) and it was verbally granted over the phone. You have been asked to make the necessary changes you have clearly made mistakes on concerning that large error made by your company but repeatedly avoid, deny, and make false, fraudulent claims about concerning the matter. This is unacceptable and you WILL be made responsible.

2 ) You have caused substantial irreputable harm to both my credit and my ability to obtain additional credit by fraudulently reporting incorrect information to all 3 credit bureaus. Facts I have NEVER been late on ANY payments ( Outside of My Rights Under the Cares Act ) on the History of this Loan. You have been sent proof of this numerous times but continue to cause malice harm financially to me by avoiding and denying proof of all payments consecutively made throughout the life of the loan. You have been billed well below the amount of what costs could be incurred and imposed on you should other avenues for recovery be taken. I strongly encourage you to take the invoice seriously and make the full payment as it has been assessed and determined to be more than fair and reasonable based on the circumstances. 

UPDATED : XX/XX/XXXX Yet again.. The proof has fell on Deaf Ears. Your Bank & Institution is Committing Fraud and Committing Clear Federal Crimes. I have alerted you to the facts of your errors in an effort for you to fix the clearly pervasive and intentional attacks. I have DEMANDED to you.. if you have Proof That there was a late payment PROVE IT!! you have not. I DEMANDED to you.. Provide the phone conversation in either transcript form or audit that I DID NOT intent to extend the Forbearance Program under the Cares Act in XXXX of XXXX and you REFUSE to Provide It. Please understand that you are not going to win this battle, and your continuation to blatantly lie will NEVER wear me down from going after the money that you have stolen from me as well as the damage you have caused financially to me that I will recover from you. 






UPDATED : XX/XX/XXXX 6 Months Later ..... I requested UNITED COMMUNITY BANK on XX/XX/XXXX to provide proof of Phone Call interactions to reveal ALL INFORMATION concerning my conversations that took place that are PROOF that I did NOT enter into ANY alternative payment programs OUTSIDE of the FOREBEARANCE program under the CARES ACT. Their direct reply to me was that the information was either non-accessible or would NOT be provided to me. This Bank is HIDING information and NOT WILLFULLY engaging in any reconcilable solutions that is required from them to with any good faith, reach a suitable resolve. In Fact, this bank has continued to attach erroneous, fraudulent fees to my mortgage account ; they have engaged in illegal direct attacks toward me by soliciting my phone number, engaging in direct threats and then after the phone calls, have within 5 minutes of the ending phone call, called me back from non-traceable phone numbers to threaten harm against my life. There is also major concern that this company has misallocated funds, used unethical accounting practices, and have disguised receiving principal / interest funds by means of multiple debit/credits that appear to be against normal accounting practices. This Bank Institution has caused irreputable harm to me financially, as well as has caused XXXX since the origin of this matter in XX/XX/XXXX. I am requesting direct assistance from CFPB to do a complete AUDIT of this companys accounting practices and to do a thorough internal investigation. I am seeking Attorney assistance as well to provide relief from the Harm this Bank Institution has caused since their hard-lined attacks and responses are clearly pervasive and of an intimidating manner. I would appreciate any assistance CFPB can provide to bring justice to the illegal practices of this bank institution.

1 ) You are being DEMANDED to reverse ALL ILLEGAL FRAUDULENT Fees on my Account and provide a check in the amount of {$1400.00} that is due to me from your bank institution for the XX/XX/XXXX over-payment that per your customer representative that is due back to me. 

2 ) You are being DEMANDED to contact ALL 3 Credit Bureau 's to correct all misinformation that you have illegally documented on my account. Directly, that I have missed payments, which has been provided to each institution that I have NOT missed a single mortgage payment as agreed on this loan.

3 ) You are being DEMANDED to get with your Attorney 's to come up with a fair and equitable monetary "" RELEIF '' amount to reconcile the harm and damage that you have caused myself, my family, and my financial well-being. 



Kind Regards, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX UPDATED : XX/XX/XXXX To whom it may concern, I have received from you, redundant, miscalculated, erroneous statements requesting additional funds and continuing your BOLD and MALICE attempts to defraud me of monetary funds. As clearly as can be said and on record : YOU ARE FRAUDS, YOU ARE COMMITING FEDERAL CRIMES, and I WILL NOT PAY YOU UNDER ANY CIRCUSTANCES!! Your replies, as committed as they may be, but for obvious deceptive reasons to not take accountability for your lies and lack of accountability, have been received. You have stated that you have no intention to resolve your discrepancies and mistakes and you have also documented clearly that you refuse to provide the requested proof due to the obvious evidence that would be unfolded and disclosed to penalize you for such misconduct and illegal activity. Baseless, erroneous letters, threatening phone calls from your representatives that hang up and call from private throw away phone numbers to threaten my life and family ONLY emboldens me to resist you further!!! You WILL NOT WIN and you Will NOT gain traction to continue threatening, harassing and attempting to defraud me. You have caused irreputable financial harm to me, my credit and my financial ability to obtain credit due to your falsification of payment history and penalties. Attached is a bill to be PAID IN FULL by you and you will continue to be billed as further financial harm is incurred as a result of your illegal activities.

3/30/2024 United Community continues to send out erroneous bills, letters and communication that is irrelevant and baseless. They are making Zero attempts at actually taking accountability for falsifying information, committing fraud and delaying further any reconciliation to their mistakes. They have additionally recommitted themselves to harassing phone calls, doubled-down on false credit reporting and new to the list of illegal falsifications, they have created bills with inaccurate balances. This company is CLEARLY laughing in the face of CFPB as well as myself at an attempt to wear me down and achieve their goals of stealing money and committing fraud. My assumption is that this will continue to go as long as they are able to continue working the system to delay, falsify and burry information and documents so that it can not be recovered. I will continue through the anticipated months and years to update this file as further threats and illegal activities continue. At some point, there will obviously be a lawsuit that will be brought before a judge & jury .... until that time, or most likely when the truth is brought to light by those with more money than me or a class action lawsuit, please continue sending me threatening letters and large packaged envelopes with large prepaid postage expenses : ). 


Kind Regards, XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX United Communities last response to my clearly issued factual complaint is yet, just another poor, pathetic attempt to transfer blame without ANY BASIS OR FACTS TO BACK UP THEIR CLAIMS. Their response that I changed my mind on extending the forbearance extension under the cares act is a sad weak approach that one takes when they have no other avenue to go. You have REFUSED to provide that proof and even went as far to communicate to me that it is not accessible without formal legal actions being taken against you to do so. As incredibly absurd as it is that you have no desire to simply reconcile this issue by revealing the TRUTH, it also clearly uncovers your liability and deliberate malicious attempts to cover up illegal activity and falsifications. Simply put, this will come to a conclusion at some point, regardless of your lies and pathetic claims. And you will be forced to take responsibility for it. As previously mentioned and in continuation, as a result of this banks illegal activities, my credit has been dramatically affected, my financial well being has been adversely impacted by credit denial, increased costs based off of a low credit store and false reporting as well as the stress and an overwhelming of false threats brought on by this bank institution including threats against myself and my family from customer service representatives calling from private or blocked numbers stating they will kill me and my family. This is a sick, disgusting group of pathetic individuals at this bank institution and I will STOP AT NOTHING till this bank is held accountable. 


Kind regards, XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX This is an Update that United Community has stood by their continuous commitment to lie and cause longstanding financial harm to me by FALSELY providing inaccurate data to the 3 credit bureau agencies as CLEAR attempts to force me into being voluntarily defrauded by their financial institution. To date, there has NEVER been a late payment and in fact, I am due a large monetary amount by this bank, separate from what is to be claimed as DAMAGES. Their FALSE claims that I simply Changed My Mind on extending, under the Cares Act, the Forbearance Program is an ABSLOUTE LIE and is the Basis for why I will NEVER PAY YOU CROOKED CRIMINAL THIEVES a single dollar of erroneous claimed amounts DUE. You are OWED NOTHING, and will paid NOTHING. You have had plenty of time to resolve this issue and know clearly well that you are in the wrong by not providing the easy documented phone call conversation outside of a court order to do so. That is your choice to NOT research and provide it, NOT mine. Please STOP lying and communicating to me that I Changed my Mind when all common sense and FACTS would clearly show that I could have easily Under the Cares Act extended the forbearance program an additional 7 to 8 months but chose not to do so. I Stand by the TRUTH of what was said on the Phone to the representative and you Screwed it up plain & simple and tried to cover that TRUTH and those FACTS by making FALSE CLAIMES. You will PAY for what you have done and continue to do to me in terms of financial harm My Promise to YOU!!! To date, there has been NO RESOLVE and ONLY further false documentation and Erroneous Fees that I fully contest and WILL NOT BE PAID. 

XX/XX/XXXX Update : This company continues to play ignorant and dumb which in fact they may very well be both, however, they are still held to a LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY to STOP committing FRAUD and FEDERAL CRIMES. You have been asked Repeatedly to FIX the enormously large number of errors embedded in those CRIMES and compensate me appropriately. The more you ignore the PROBLEM the larger it will get. Please hold this BANK INSTITUTION accountable and appropriately investigate."

When I called to dispute the closure, I was told there was no way to reopen the account or stop the negative credit reporting. This closure feels unjustified and unfair, as I acted in good faith by paying the balance before the due date.

I believe Discovers decision was made in error, and it has the potential to cause harm to my credit, despite my adherence to payment deadlines. 

I am requesting that my account be reopened, that no negative information be reported to the credit bureaus, and that I receive a clear explanation of why my account was closed despite my timely payment."

Debt collection,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive enough information to verify debt,"Date : XX/XX/XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Subject : Request for Intervention and Issuance of Form 1099-C by LVNV Funding LLC Dear CFPB, I am writing to lodge a formal complaint against LVNV Funding LLC for their ongoing failure to provide a 1099-C for a charged-off debt and for not adhering to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Account Details : Original Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX  Account Number : XXXX Charge-Off Amount : {$6300.00} Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Last Activity : XX/XX/XXXX Current Status : Collection/Charge-off Background : Despite my diligent efforts to resolve this matter lawfully, LVNV Funding has consistently failed to provide the necessary documentation or proof of debt as requested. This includes their inability to supply a 1099-C form for the charged-off debt, which is essential for proper financial documentation and tax reporting. The absence of this form not only complicates my financial obligations but also raises concerns about their adherence to legal and ethical debt collection and reporting standards. 

Issues Encountered : Failure to Provide 1099-C : LVNV Funding has not issued a 1099-C for the charged-off debt, complicating my ability to accurately file taxes and manage my financial responsibilities. 

Inaccurate Reporting : The account continues to be reported on my credit files without proper validation and with significant discrepancies in payment history and monthly reporting. 

Lack of Compliance with FDCPA : Repeated requests for debt validation have been ignored or inadequately responded to, in direct violation of the FDCPA. 

Potential Fraudulent Reporting : The persistence of LVNV Funding in not providing necessary documentation upon request suggests a disregard for legal obligations, potentially qualifying as a fraudulent activity under federal law. 

Conclusion : This complaint serves as a formal request for the CFPB 's immediate intervention to ensure that my consumer rights are not continuously infringed upon. Failure to address these concerns satisfactorily will compel me to seek further legal advice and possibly initiate legal action for damages incurred due to these violations, including slander, defamation, mental anguish, and stress. 

I am prepared to take all necessary steps to defend my rights and ensure compliance with federal regulations, and I urge the CFPB to assist in resolving this matter expediently. 

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter."
Debt collection,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"I want to stress that I did not give written permission for these specific transactions to be included in my consumer report. At no point did I authorize these entries, and their presence on my report is unwarranted. Consequently, I am formally requesting that these accounts be blocked and removed from my report immediately. 

It is important to clarify that this request is not due to any error or negligence on my part. There has been no oversight or misunderstanding on my end. Instead, this issue arises solely from the fact that I did not explicitly authorize the inclusion of these transactions in my report. I am diligent about maintaining the accuracy and privacy of my financial records, and these unauthorized entries compromise that integrity. 

I trust that you will handle this matter with the urgency and seriousness it deserves. Please confirm the removal of these transactions from my report as soon as possible. Thank you for your prompt attention to this issue."

The result is Chase XXXX charges a "" late fee '' and perhaps interest on the amount due. 

My suspicion is this is deliberate and especially previlant during the holiday season when few people will question the extra charge or cancel their card in favor on one with more favorable terms. Of course, they can claim it's the post office which is at fault, but I suspect this is just another scheme to make money at the consumer 's expense."

Debt collection,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"I received services at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and was on a payment plan to cover my balance. During my initial visit, I informed the XXXX that I am a XXXX XXXX managing expenses on my own. Despite this, the office placed me on a payment plan that has now led to financial distress, which I believe could have been handled more responsibly. 

According to the office 's portal, my total bill was {$2600.00}. My insurance covered {$1700.00}, leaving me responsible for {$900.00}. I made six monthly payments of {$120.00}, plus a {$100.00} down payment, totaling {$820.00}. Despite this, I was told that {$700.00} of my balance has been sent to collections. 

The portal inaccurately shows that I have only paid {$170.00} toward my account, even though I have receipts confirming the payments. This discrepancy has not been adequately explained, and the office has not clarified how my payments were applied. 

When I contacted the XXXX  office to address these concerns, I was informed that accounts are sent to collections after 90 days of non-payment. However, my last payment of {$120.00} was processed on XX/XX/2024, which contradicts this policy. 

The representative I spoke with seemed uncertain and deflected my questions about the payment discrepancy. Instead of addressing my concerns, they focused on defending the decision to send the debt to collections. After I sent an email demanding written confirmation of the debt, I received a call back hours later. 

During the call, the representative suddenly cited a contract that I allegedly signed in XX/XX/2024. This contract was only sent to me after I pressed the issue, raising concerns about whether the terms are accurate or retroactively altered. Additionally, I never received a copy of this contract at the time I signed it, and I could not find it in my email records from XXXX. 

Lastly, I discovered the notice of the collections referral in my spam folder, meaning I was not adequately informed or given a fair opportunity to resolve the balance before it was sent to collections. 

I believe I have been unfairly treated due to billing errors, poor communication, delayed sharing of documentation, and deflective behavior from the representative, which has caused unnecessary financial and emotional stress. 
I believe I should have been provided with a copy of the contract at the time of signing or immediately after the treatment. The fact that it was only shared with me after I pressed the issue raises concerns about transparency and accountability"

I have spoken with my previous bank and they provided me with documentation verifying this was inaccurate which I sent to Fay, as well as my previous bank has confirmed they have sent over all supporting documentation regarding the draw and the erroneous fees. I have been calling Fay for the last 4 months and they will not fix the fees nor will they acknowledge the draw.

I was told that in a few months interest rates would be dropping and I could refinance the car. The cash price of the vehicle is significantly higher than what the car books for. No reputable bank would loan money on a car for more than it is worth. I tried to contact the bank and told them my concerns about the loan and contract as soon as I realized what happened. I wanted to see a copy of the credit application the dealership sent them to verify the information they were given. I wanted to make sure the dealership didn't say I was purchasing a car with a more luxury trim or with a bigger engine to justify more money than the car was worth. The bank told me they didn't have my credit application. I asked them how they were able to approve a loan without a credit application. Then I asked to speak with a supervisor and I asked again for a copy of the credit application they received when they agreed to loan money to me. Again I was refused and told that it wasn't in my file yet, but the loan already was. They told me it could take 45 days to have that information ( coincidentally after the first payment is due ) I asked them again how they were able to approve loans without credit applications on file. The supervisor had no answer for this. I believe Fifth Third Bank and the dealership conspired to enter me into a predatory auto loan that I would not be able to refinance with another bank."

At no time did the card issuer or their fraud department contact me or freeze my card, or try to warn me about what was going on. XXXX XXXX XXXX and credit card company insiders, both informed me, that card issuers often notice a big change in spending habits as a possible sign of fraud. But TD Bank NA took no action to help me while I was being scammed, abused, and exploited. As typical for most XXXX  scam victims, at that time, I did not realize I was being scammed as it was quite early in the long con process. A warning from TD Bank may have been of great help. Later, I did wake up, but now, I am being sued by the collector and TD Bank N.A.. who have shown no compassion so far, for what has happened to me. In cases of ID Theft or if someone stole your card or number it is one thing, but apparently when you've been scammed or extorted it is another.

Please do not do anything for anybody unless you have met them in person or you know for very sure it is a real relationship. If you have met in person and met their family is a good sign, but IF there is a huge age difference and they come from a third world country with poverty, please be on special alert.

Mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,I recently obtained a mortgage with PenFed end of XX/XX/year>. In XXXX we thought we had set up auto pay to start with the XXXX payment. In XXXX I received an alert saying I was 30 days late from XXXX XXXX. We called in to find out why payment did not pull and were told we did not set up autopay. At this time my husband requested this be looked into and we made the payments to bring account current. He did not receive a call back so I then called in. I let the person know we have not received any statements. It has been confirmed the address in the loan system was set up wrong. The closing paperwork did have a correct mailing address that we were using. In addition we were told that PenFed did try to call but did NOT leave voicemail messages so we had no idea that there was an issue. The number that they call from does not indicate PenFed so we had no idea they were calling or it would have alerted me to an issue. In addition they indicated they did not have my contact number which I find strange since I can see it on the final application paperwork. Customer Service is now saying on XXXX we made a 1 time payment and then setup auto pay and then deleted autopay at the same time which does not seem correct or was an system error. If we had received any statements I would have known my payment was missed and made it prior to the 30 day late which has now impacted my credit greatly. We had also prior to the XXXX payment had the address updated but it was only updated in the retail side. We were not told until recently that you have to contact each department to update information. Customer service spoke with collections who has indicated that they will not change the reporting. Based on the fact that the company had information to reach me and provide a monthly statement I feel like PenFed contributed to my payment being late. I pulled up my final loan paperwork and show the mailing address was not the physical address and my phone number was on final loan application. PenFed would have received this paperwork from the escrow company prior to my loan funding. I am trying to work with customer service to get this resolved but have now been told 4 times that they will not fix this. I feel this is poor customer service and that they did not meet the requirement to send me my mortgage statement monthly. I also feel them indicating that they tried contacting us by calling but never leaving a message is not satisfactory.
Mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Changes in loan terms during or after closing,"XXXX loan application was processed with EMM Loans LLC XXXX I spoke to XXXX XXXX. He advised rate was XXXX with XXXX points. Did tell me hed lock either the next day in the morning or the day after as he was expecting rates to drop. I asked him 2x if theres a risk of an increase, he said absolutely no. Loan process continued. Original loan disclosure has rate at XXXX with no fees to buy the rate. 

Multiple people from EMM Loans reached out asking for information, at times 3x for the same information.

It was disclosed from day 1 that I would be closing from Florida while my husband would physically be in Texas, where the property is located. 

Loan was scheduled to close on XX/XX/XXXX. On evening of XX/XX/XXXX after becoming increasingly alarmed that I could not get a hold of XXXX, I reached out to VP XXXX XXXX via text. He responded that it was after hours on a Friday and hed look into it on Monday or over weekend. Later sent text that we were closing on XX/XX/XXXX as scheduled. 

On Monday XX/XX/XXXX, received a call from yet another person, XXXX XXXX. He indicated that I would not be able to close remote and would need to give my husband POA to close on my behalf. I refused, he then suggested that my husband give me POA to close in Florida. I indicated Id check with my husband and he was going to confirm that could be done and work on getting POA drafted. Did not hear back. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received the 3 day notice of disclosure. There I learned that I would have to buy down the rate to get 5.5 % and that my loan rate was never locked. The lock document says XX/XX/XXXX. 

I asked for a call. XXXX told me that there wasnt anything he could do with current interest rates to change them and that he did not know what XXXX had done. He indicated hed call me back, he did not. I did not sign the 3 day notice. 

I reached out to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to cancel the loan. In a subsequent call with the title company, they advised that it would have been perfectly fine for me to close remote via Zoom and my husband would sign physically in Texas. Indicated it was a common practice. 

I have a financial loss as a result of the inappropriate handling on my loan by the team at EMM Loans. I paid a credit check, an appraisal, inspections and {$3900.00} in escrow to the seller. I am also at risk of the seller coming after me for additional monies, per my realtor, as the house has sat off the market for just over 6 weeks."

On XX/XX/XXXX FROM THE XXXX XXXX XXXX a XXXX based company and representatives of said company settled upon a HELOC LOAN with XXXX XXXX XXXX. We assumed the company was acting in good faith but after further investigation of the mortgage we found that the companies involved acted in bad faith. Falsification of submitted documents, signatures, recordings in the courts, double bookkeeping entries, and the transfer of the asset. XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, U.S. BANK XXXX XXXX XXXX ( not in its official capacity solely as trustee for XXXX XXXX XXXX, are apart of this fraudulent transfer of the asset. We noticed a discrepancies once were we contacted by XXXX XXXX XXXX that claimed payments were missed ( default ) and that immediate payment was needed or they would accelerate to foreclosure proceedings. XX/XX/XXXX was the referenced date in which a payment was made and accepted by XXXX XXXX XXXX. The payment included the 3 months of payments plus interest. XXXX XXXX  had direct access to the account to retrieve funds do to the account made payable was set up through autopay at XXXX XXXX  located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX, Pa XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX claimed the same issue XXXX of XXXX in which payment was made again to XXXX XXXX XXXX and accepted. That is when we started to research the issue with payments and the account. We reached out to XXXX XXXX  to investigate the allegations made by XXXX XXXX XXXX that we were not making payments as scheduled from autopay out of the account held by XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX  informed us of the transaction history and found that XXXX XXXX DID INDEED receive payment electronically from the autopay set up on the account. There was no return funds from XXXX XXXX XXXX back to the account only payments sent. XXXX XXXX XXXX claimed that on the first of every month they would retrieve the payment, and then they would return the payment on the XXXX of every month. XXXX XXXX XXXX when asked claimed that they never received the payments and they returned what the did receive during that transaction. But after investigating the transaction with XXXX XXXX  we concluded that something was not right. XXXX XXXX  launched an investigation into the account which caused a domino affect into the hardships now faced by our family. With the account being on hold do to investigation it created economic hardships. Which affected our personal and business credit profiles, missed payments to other accounts and tons of pain and suffering. Which ended up with the account being closed. We experienced identity theft issues do to the negligence of XXXX XXXX XXXX and its agents and affiliates. XXXX XXXX XXXX then accelerated to foreclosure proceedings in which we were contacted by a lawyer based in XXXX. We were not properly served and did not receive any proper form of communication. From XXXX of XXXX Until XXXX of XXXX we tried to reach a conclusion with XXXX XXXX XXXX. We researched the transaction from the best of our knowledge with clean hands and honor. Due to the lack of information being shared by the companies, we could only gather as much information as publicly possible. XXXX XXXX US BANK XXXX XXXX. AND XXXX XXXX XXXX claimed that they did not have to disclose account information to the account holder because it was company policy. But in Pennsylvania the right to know law a adopted interpretation of the FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT, states we have right to full disclosure of any information. After several attempts and blatant refusal by the companies we pursued to gather what we could. Starting at the beginning, what is a mortgage? What type of mortgage do we have? What bank or banks are involved? etc.. We concluded with a few red flags starting with the settlement. Loan amount was for XXXX in which on the day of closing only about XXXX was deposited we asked why and was informed it went into the escrow account incase payments can not be made. So we looked into escrow accounts and according the IRS PUBLICATION 537 the buyers obligation is paid in full when the balance of purchase price is deposited into the escrow account. When the escrow account is established, you no longer rely on the buyer for the rest of the payment, but on the escrow arrangement. Which means they held another XXXX in the escrow account along with the funds deducted from the initial amount. Which led us further into what accounting means, double bookkeeping entry systems, and all that involved XXXX XXXX, and XXXX. We tracked the account all the way into a Fund held by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX being sold on the market. Which meant that our transaction was a secondary one and that we were never compensated and valuable consideration for the cashable item used by the bank to secure funding. We now know that the application was a cashable item and was pooled with other items and being serviced under one account. Which lead us into how the loan was structured and the identity of all parties. This information was not disclosed to us in anyway. We were unaware of the funds held in escrow by the title company the day of settlement. That they use false misleading business tactics like taking the escrow after the fact to mask what intentions they truly have. We found that banks can not lend there own money. We found that banks are borrowers of the FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM operating circular 9. We found that UCCC ( that all banks are intermediaries ). We found that banks invest on behalf of customers and investors. We are the customers, our taxpayer identification number was used in this transaction. Which means that this is a tax issue and according to IRS PUBLICATION 4681. In which the parties involved are falsifying documents submitting and not submitting tax forms using legalese to mislead cause economic harm etc. We have proof of the accounting from an independent audit, and almost positive that once full accounting is obtained we may also conclude all the violations this transaction. With further investigation we found that sharing account information with anyone outside the account holder is a violation major violation according to the FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION etc... We have tried to settle the matter but all the parties involved have provided a safe avenue to redemption of the mortgage. We have a right to equitable redemption. We are the Owners of the accounts all proceeds rights titles interest chattels rents debits credits debentures derivatives. As these company are using unjust enrichment errors of omission, piracy, identity theft, bank levy, false tax reporting 's securities reporting financial statements agreements etc. filed with SEC and local and state departments of revenue etc..

The servicer or attorney is liable for the tax, or whoever did not transfer it in time. Keep in mind that if the REMIC takes the defaulted note and transfers it after the 3 month deadline the whole REMIC loses it's tax status.

How does a REMIC acquire property?

Formation and Initial Transfer of Assets : When a REMIC is initially formed, it acquires a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed assets from a transferor, typically using a trust agreement. This transfer is often part of the REMICs creation, where the transferor places qualifying mortgages or mortgage-related assets into the REMIC structure .

Form 1066, U.S. Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit ( REMIC ) Income Tax Return, is then used by the REMIC to report its income and tax elections but is not required to formally acquire the property.

Foreclosure and Election for Foreclosure Property : When the REMIC acquires property through foreclosure or similar means ( if a borrower defaults on a mortgage within the REMIC ), it can make an election to treat the property as foreclosure property. This is done on Form 1066 by attaching a statement to the form for the tax year in which the REMIC acquires the property.

This election classifies the foreclosed property as foreclosure property, which is important for favorable tax treatment, as it avoids having the income from the property treated as prohibited income for REMIC purposes.

Reporting Requirements : While Form 1066 is the primary reporting form, theres no form specifically required to acquire property into the REMIC. Instead, the acquisition is documented through legal agreements and records with the trust administrator, often filed in county records for foreclosures.

Schedule Q ( Form 1066 ) is also used by the REMIC to report information to residual interest holders, including details about the income and property held by the REMIC.

Form 1066 Statement : This statement is an attachment to Form 1066, U.S. Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit ( REMIC ) Income Tax Return.

It includes details about the property that the REMIC acquired through foreclosure and an explicit election under IRC 856 ( e ) to treat the property as foreclosure property.

Purpose : This election allows the REMIC to classify the property as foreclosure property for tax purposes, meaning it can avoid taxes on income that would otherwise be considered non-qualifying income.

Form 1099-A : Form 1099-A is issued by a lender when there is an acquisition or abandonment of secured property, typically by a financial institution to report the acquisition or abandonment of property to both the IRS and the borrower .

Purpose : For the REMIC, Form 1099-A is relevant only if the REMIC must report the acquisition or abandonment of a secured property ( typically when the borrower defaults and the REMIC acquires the property ). The REMIC might use Form 1099-A to document the foreclosure for reporting purposes.

Key Detail : Form 1099-A is sent to the IRS and the borrower, while the election statement attached to Form 1066 is only for the IRS to claim the foreclosure property status.

Finally, I showed proof I tried to dispute this with XXXX and they still keep collecting. I then file a complaint with your agency showing you XXXX still keeps trying to cheat me and collect on something I cancelled. 

You know what XXXX does? XXXX says my cancelation is invalid because I was past due in XXXX and I tried cancelling in XXXX. It is the dumbest thing I ever heard in my life. What do you mean my cancelation is invalid? They have to accept my cancelation no matter how much money I owe. So just because someone is a past month due, they can't cancel services? So, a company can just keep billing someone forever? We both know that is not true, but the collection is making that stupid excuse to YOU to keep breaking the law and keep trying to collect from me. Now they are saying if I pay this in full, they will delete it. But why should I pay for something I don't owe, already paid, and cancelled numerous times? 

And their excuse is stupid for other reasons too. Even if I was late in XXXX when I cancelled in XXXX, the paperwork they showed me with all the payments says I paid them in full {$320.00} in XXXX and there was {$0.00} balance. That is after I already cancelled Brinks in XXXX in writing. If I cancelled them in XXXX, and I paid them in full in XXXX, then why they keep billing me after that? I will now show you their stupid response they filed to you and their new e-mail trying to have me pay them. 

Must I hire lawyer to sue them? Do they just get to say lies to you and get away with it? Does this complaint even do anything? Please help me to get them to stop collecting this debt I do not owe. I did everything right and I already paid."

Upon conducting thorough research via the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), I confirmed that LVNV Funding LLC is not licensed to collect debts in the state of Virginia, where I reside. This is a direct violation of Virginia Code 6.2-1602, which prohibits any company from engaging in debt collection activities within the state without proper licensing. Collecting debts without a valid license is considered unlawful and invalidates the companys ability to enforce collection in Virginia courts.

Furthermore, the presence of this entry violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681, which requires that all information included in credit reports be accurate, complete, and verifiable. Since LVNV Funding LLC lacks the legal credentials to operate in Virginia, this entry can not be considered valid or verifiable.

I believe their actions violate my consumer rights. Below, I outline the details of the situation : XXXX. Date of Contact and Request : On XX/XX/year>, I contacted National Debt Relief to request the cancellation of a scheduled payment of {$XXXX} set to be deducted from my account on XX/XX/year>. I was informed that it was too late to stop the transaction, which I understood. 
XXXX. Subsequent Request for Refund : I explicitly instructed National Debt Relief that once the XX/XX/XXXX payment cleared, they were not to use the funds for any settlements and that the money should be refunded to me. Despite my clear request, they disregarded my instructions and informed me the money would be used for a settlement without my consent. 
XXXX. XXXX of Events : The {$XXXX} payment was taken from my bank account on XX/XX/year>. 
National Debt Relief informed me the funds would clear on XX/XX/year>. 
I repeatedly reiterated my request for a refund, but they refused to comply, stating the funds had already been applied to a settlement.

4. Violation of My Rights : I believe National Debt Reliefs refusal to refund my money violates my rights as a consumer. I have the right to control how my money is used, especially after making a clear request. Their unwillingness to respect my instructions has caused unnecessary stress and financial difficulty.

5. Nature of the Company : National Debt Relief is a debt consolidation company that works on behalf of clients to settle debts. However, in this instance, they have failed to act in my best interest or honor my explicit requests.

Resolution Sought : I am requesting that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and ensure that National Debt Relief issues a full refund of the funds in question. Additionally, I ask that steps be taken to ensure this company adheres to proper consumer protection practices in the future.

Thank you for your time and assistance in this matter. I am happy to provide any further details or documentation needed for your investigation."

I previously requested debt validation from the collection agency handling this account, but they failed to provide the required validation. According to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) 809 ( a ), a collection agency must provide verification of the debt upon request. Since the collection agency has not provided this validation, the collection account should not be reported on my credit file. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 611 ( a ), I am requesting that you reinvestigate this matter. The continued reporting of this collection account without proper validation is inaccurate and violates the FDCPA. Please remove this collection account from my credit report and provide written confirmation of this action. If the collection agency can not validate the debt, the account must be deleted from my credit file as required by law. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your response. Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX"
"Payday loan, title loan, personal loan, or advance loan",Problem with the payoff process at the end of the loan,None,"The loan was paid in full on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a confirmation email that the loan was paid in full. 
My account online showed the account as paid in full. 

XXXX week later BestEgg attempted to withdraw money from my account. I contacted them and was told it was an error and would stop after that attempt. 

This fund withdrawl request was repeated XXXX additional times after that. Upon checking my closed account on XX/XX/XXXX, it displayed an outstanding payment of {$XXXX} with a payoff amount of {$XXXX}. This was highly suspicious and prompted my call to BestEgg. 

They were not very helpful, initially the agent would not admit that payments were being taken. After carefully trying to explain the situation he FINALLY looked into my account and told me that it was closed and he couldn't explain why money was continuing to be taken out. 

The side effect of this action has been the inability to use my own checking account for the means it was intended for! 
I can not keep money in that account for fear BestEgg will attempt to steal it! 
I can not pay my other liabilities through autopay, and benefit from the savings doing so, and often other liabilities are paid late as a direct result of not using autopay. 

This action by BestEgg has indirectly caused me additional financial burdens, has highly inconvenienced my day to day activities and has reduced the amount of expendable income available to sustain my family. 

I was previously enrolled in a debt settlement program with XXXX XXXX, which, as an indirect result of XXXX  's actions, has been terminated due to autopayments not being available and there being no method of making a manual payment to XXXX XXXX. This has had, and XXXX continue to have, dire consequences against my current and future credit scores. 

I would like to request an investigation into XXXX  's lending practices and an audit on any accounts active or closed, to ensure fair lending practices are being adhered to. 

I fear that other customers that aren't as knowledgeable or attentive XXXX have paid far more than they should have and/or XXXX have had XXXX XXXX reductions as a result of these deceptive lending practices."

Mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Foreclosure,"Morgage company refuses to review loan mod package or send to the investor they deny the package constantly and offer unaffordable excessive suprime repayment plans!!! 

Here is their latest communication : Your loan is not impounded/escrowed for SN Servicing to pay the Property Taxes or Homeowners Insurance as thats your responsibility. Unfortunately the property taxes were delinquent/unpaid to the point where the investors decided in order to protect their interest in the property and avoid the possibility of a tax foreclosure and there be legal fees & costs that would have to be paid as well as the delinquent taxes the investors made the decision to advance and pay the delinquent XXXX and XXXX County Taxes to XXXX XXXX County in the amount of {$34000.00}, which was paid in XX/XX/year>. The tax advance needs to be repaid. 



The XX/XX/year> through XX/XX/year> mortgage payments are currently due. Your monthly Principal & Interest payment is {$5700.00} so just in payments youre looking at {$57000.00} through XX/XX/year>. If you combine the {$34000.00} XXXX XXXX it bring just for payments and tax advance to {$92000.00}, but thats not even full reinstatement, since theres legal fees & costs, NSF charges and late charges. The investors had previously offered a 6 Month Repayment Plan, but it was declined. The investors are not offering anything else other than a 6 Month Repayment Plan. If youre interested Ill order a reinstatement quote, which will be e-mailed to you so youll have the default amount needing to be cured. 

Here is my response- XXXX we are asking that you send this to the investor and asking that you send a denial letter for the requested loan modification which you keep stating it was denied but have never given a reason why? What is the reason for the denial when it can not be income. The income was sufficient. We feel you have NO VALID reasons once again. We have tried every possible way to work with SN servicing and have exhausted all resources besides superior court complaints and imminent bankruptcy XXXX. 



I received your inconsiderate email stating that the investors paid delinquent property taxes on my behalf and are demanding repayment on top of arrears. I understand the importance of paying property taxes but we were in a California relief program that they denied us due to lack of funds. All the while saying that we were approved. They also made contact with SN and sent a form and you failed to communicate! You could have moved the paid taxes to the back of the loan. You cant harm the homeowner who is already delinquent with a demand to pay XXXX. I was not informed about the tax payments until after you made payment and was not given a chance to pay them myself!!! Why? Seems like you enjoy working against homeowners at SN servicing. This is why your company has so many lawsuits against you. 



According to your email, the total amount owed is {$92000.00}, which includes the tax advance and accrued interest. I understand that this amount is due, but I CAN NOT afford to over the short six month payment timeline!! 

It is unacceptable, unreasonable, excessive and extreme. 



To propose a repayment plan, I offer the following : - For the next 6 months, I will pay {$7700.00} per month, which will cover the arrears and a portion of the accrued interest. - After 6 months, I will resume making my regular monthly payments of {$5700.00}. To calculate the total number of months needed to pay off the arrears, I have divided the total amount owed by my monthly payment : {$92000.00} ( total amount ) {$7700.00} ( monthly payment for 6 months ) = 12 months ( approximately ) However, since I will be paying {$7700.00} for only 6 months, the total number of months needed to pay off the arrears will be longer!!! You as the servicer are nit offering true loss mitigation if you are listening to what a homeowner can afford. 



To estimate this, I have calculated : {$92000.00} ( total amount ) - {$46000.00} ( total payments for 6 months ) = {$46000.00} ( remaining balance ) {$46000.00} ( remaining balance ) {$5700.00} ( regular monthly payment ) = 8 months ( approximately )! 



Therefore, it will take me approximately 14 months ( 6 months at {$7700.00} + 8 months at {$5700.00} ) to pay off the arrears. 



Please confirm if this repayment plan is acceptable to the investors. If not, I request that you provide a detailed breakdown of the reinstatement quote, including all fees and charges, so I can understand the total amount and negotiate a feasible repayment plan through immediate XXXX  XXXX workout. 



I look forward to the response of the investor and not your made up responses and unofficial notes. 



Reply all to ALL government agencies and counsel. I agree to all recipients on this thread to receive the communication. Each email address is authorized by XXXX XXXX. M My advisory group wrote this- XXXX XXXX , We intend to come up with a solution for XXXX XXXX to resume her mortgage payments and save her home, and we need your cooperation. We are here to make arrangements for this to work out for the homeowner using every means possible. She knew her responsibility and obligations when she acquired this mortgage loan but did not expect her financials to be affected when the COVID-19 financials caught her off guard, and she was just recently approved for a loan modification 2 years ago. Having said that, it's unnecessary to remind her of obligations on the mortgage, nor are you in a position to suggest a motion in a Bankruptcy court since you are not an attorney. Please refrain from suggesting that since you are unaware of her financial distress. When she began falling behind on the mortgage payments, she also began falling behind on the property taxes. Still, she took the initiative to apply to the state program that assists homeowners affected by COVID-19 financial distress to have their property taxes resolved. Unfortunately, we found out later that she was qualified, but the state and the government ran out of funds. Naturally, as stated on the loan documents she received when she acquired this loan, the investor paid the property taxes since they are also the loan owners, as you understand. XXXX XXXX has agreed to a reasonable payment plan but with you adding the taxes to the plan it makes it unaffordable. You suggested a payment of over XXXX, which falls in a subprime lending category. This does not sound as if you are seeking to help the homeowner. XXXX mentioned several times the offer for a repayment plan and why she qualifies for it. We are greatly thankfull for the opportunity but its a monthly payment that the homeowner wont be able to keep up. 

We are requesting that the investor give her the chance to revise her income and expenses for a loan modification or a repayment plan where she can affordably catch up over 5 years or more. If that's not an option for her, according to what you have mentioned in the past, we need an actual denial with reasons why on a letter so XXXX XXXX can reach out to other options.

I asked to be mailed a statement as I had never seen nor expected a statement as I never had used the card. He stated that the investigation team would investigate and get back to me by XX/XX/XXXX until the investigation is closed that it would be resolved. On XX/XX/XXXX I received notice that the case was resolved. I thought at that time that the issue was done. XXXX had stated that Barclays would contact the credit rating companies to correct the report. 
This case resulted in my excellent credit rating downgrade due to negative hit from past due bill since the credit card company did not suspend the charge while investigation was ongoing. I had filed an identity theft report with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) to report the incident and protect myself from identity theft should something arise in the future. The reference number is : XXXX. 
I contacted Barclays on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to an agent named XXXX after I was contacted by XXXX XXXX a collection agency, stating that my account was sold to them for collections. XXXX at Barclays stated that there were a few charges they needed me to confirm that I hadnt charged and were fraudulent which I did. I asked XXXX to send me written motivation of the status of the investigation and for a reason the account was sold to XXXX XXXX before the investigation was complete. I have not received anything from XXXX telling me about their investigation. There is no way there is any substantiation that these charges are mine. Prior to this issue I have had an excellent credit rating. On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Barclays again to find out the outcome of the additional investigation charges and spoke to agent XXXX  who initially had no information, but said I should contact another number which I saw was XXXX XXXX  I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told there were none available. I asked him to have a supervisor contact me and he said he would put in a follow up but would not explain how I would be contacted. Because I have received no info other than my case was concluded and written off by XXXX, I am concluding that my case was never investigated before being sent to collection. Because if it was investigated they would find that the charges were not made by me.

In order to speak with a representative, I used my account information to get in touch, but I explicitly informed them that I was requesting the closure of my fathers account, not mine. I provided my fathers personal information, including his name, but did not give his account number, as I did not have it readily available. 

Despite clearly explaining the situation, an error occurred when Discovers automated system mistakenly associated my account with the call. As a result, my account was closed rather than my fathers. According to Discovers response, the lack of an associated account number caused confusion, yet they fail to mention that it was their responsibility to ensure the accuracy of the information used to process this request. I clearly communicated the situation, and their system should have verified the details to prevent such a mistake. 

Although I resolved the issue initially and continued to make regular payments, I later discovered that my account was closed again without any notification, and I was sent to collections. I continued making payments as normal, unaware of the account closure or the collections action. 

In their response, Discover acknowledged the mistake, explaining that the lack of an associated account number caused the confusion. They also stated that the charge-off status was removed and the payment history updated. However, despite this, my account remains marked as "" closed by credit grantor, '' which negatively impacts my credit. Furthermore, Discover did not reopen my account as requested, and I was not compensated for the inconvenience or financial impact caused by their repeated errors."

I have attempted to settle for a lesser amount, as I believe this debt is not mine, but my offers have been met with refusal. Additionally, I proposed arbitration in hopes of resolving this matter amicably, yet I have not received any satisfactory response. 

It is deeply concerning that I have not received any proof or verification of this debt despite my repeated attempts to clarify the situation. I have maintained records of all correspondence, including letters and tracking numbers, as well as emails with timestamps.

XXXX Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , I am writing to file a formal complaint against XXXX  and American Express concerning false advertising and an unjust resolution of my dispute regarding Reservation ID : XXXX. I respectfully request your intervention to address this matter and ensure fair treatment for consumers like myself. 
False Advertising by Booking.com On XX/XX/year> I booked a property through XXXX  ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The property was falsely advertised as a NON SMOKING ROOM. However, upon arrival, it was clear that these claims were entirely untrue. 
The unit was heavily impregnated with the odor of tobacco smoke, contradicting its advertised description. This issue rendered the property uninhabitable and significantly deviated from the promised conditions. I was misled into booking the unit based on these misrepresentations, which constitutes deceptive advertising. 
American Express 's Failure to Protect Consumers When I sought to dispute the charges with American Express, providing clear evidence of the false advertising and my efforts to resolve the matter directly with XXXX American Express refused my dispute. By doing so, they have effectively allowed their vendor to lure customers under false pretenses and escape accountability for deceptive practices. 
This situation highlights a failure to protect consumers from unfair business practices. As a credit card issuer, American Express has a responsibility to ensure that their vendors adhere to ethical and honest standards of conduct. Their refusal to support my legitimate claim undermines this responsibility and leaves consumers vulnerable to exploitation. 
Request for Intervention I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and intervene to : 1. Review XXXX  Practices : Ensure that properties listed on their platform meet their advertised descriptions and hold XXXX accountable for enabling false advertising. 
2. Address American Expresss Handling of Disputes : Require American Express to review their dispute resolution process and reverse their decision in this case, as it fails to protect consumers from deceptive business practices. 
3. Strengthen Consumer Protections : Advocate for stricter oversight of credit card issuers and platforms like XXXX to prevent future cases of false advertising and insufficient consumer recourse. 
Conclusion This situation is not only about my individual experience but also about holding companies accountable for ethical business practices and ensuring fair treatment for consumers. I trust that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will take appropriate action to address this matter and protect others from facing similar injustices. 
Thank you for your attention to this issue. I look forward to your guidance and resolution.

Mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure","This is a continuation of Complaint XXXX, where among other things I requested that the servicer permit a partial reinstatement of the loan. I have been told that because my loan is in foreclosure, I am ineligible for a partial reinstatement. Despite this, the current servicer invited me to apply for either a partial or full reinstatement in XXXX of 2024. I ask that the servicer be required to honor its obligation, or correct the error of placing my loan in foreclosure. 

It should be pointed out that some of the issues may be because the servicing of my loan was transferred. It is not clear if the new servicer has access to, or has reviewed all of the file, or the completed loss mitigation application. 

That said, the current servicer continues to ignore that the loan should never have been referred to foreclosure. This is because before it was referred and placed in foreclosure I already submitted a complete loss mitigation application. The completed loss mitigation application was submitted on XX/XX/year> and the loan was referred to foreclosure XXXX  days later on XX/XX/year> ( per the servicer 's records as noted in your prior response ). I have previously submitted copies of the completed loss mitigation application to the servicer. 

Sending my loan for foreclosure referral represents dual tracking under Regulation Z, and is not permitted which the CFPB summarizes as follows : "" Servicers can not start a foreclosure proceeding if a borrower has already submitted a complete application for a loan modification or other alternative to foreclosure, and that application is still pending review. '' And this is exactly what happened here. 

In XXXX of 2024 I spoke with the servicer, and we went through a partial reinstatement analysis. I was initially told that the loan was eligible and that the partial reinstatement figure was {$37000.00}. As the call proceeded, however, she told me that the loan had just been referred to foreclosure and therefore it was no longer eligible. I was told that the ONLY reason my loan was ineligible for a partial reinstatement was because the loan had been referred to foreclosure. Because this is a mistake that the servicer should correct, once corrected the loan will be eligible for a partial reinstatement. 

Accordingly, I am not requesting a custom loss mitigation option, rather a partial reinstatement. A partial reinstatement is available from the investor regardless of default status as long as the loan is not in foreclosure. As noted above, the loan should not have been in foreclosure because a complete loss mitigation application had already been submitted. 

Finally, the servicer sent me a letter in XXXX of 2024 stating that I could apply for either a partial or full reinstatement. I told the servicer I again wanted a partial reinstatement. Despite being told I could request a partial reinstatement, I was only offered a full reinstatement. The servicer should be required to honor its offer."

Mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,Confusing or misleading advertising or marketing,"In XXXX, I contacted Newrez to initiate a buyout assumption for the mortgage on a property I co-own with my friend. The goal was to transfer the loan into my name, removing my friend from liability. Throughout multiple calls and emails, I clearly explained our situation and was guided through the steps to complete the assumption. At no point was I informed that relationship status ( as non-relatives ) would make us ineligible. Based on Newrezs assurances, my wife and I made significant life decisions, including hiring movers costing {$1700.00} and relocating to the property, assuming we would keep the favorable interest rate of 3.2 %. However, a few days ago, over the phone, the loan officer handling our case asked if my friend and I were related. When I said no, he stated the assumption could not proceed because we are not relatives and expressed surprise that we had made it this far in the process, as our relationship status should have been addressed months ago. I was told the only way to remove my friend from the mortgage was to refinance, which would mean losing the current interest rate. This contradicts months of guidance from Newrez, who knew from the beginning that my friend and I were not related. Nowhere in their documents, communications, or website is it stated that assumptions are restricted to relatives. Their failure to disclose this policy upfront caused unnecessary stress and financial harm. Had we been informed earlier, we would not have moved or gone through this process. Additionally, I could find no legal requirement limiting buyout assumptions to relatives, suggesting this is an internal policy that should have been disclosed at the outset. This process has been unnecessarily stressful, and I believe Newrez should be held accountable for their negligence and misrepresentation."

Debt collection,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I initially reached out to Jefferson Capital and requested verification of the debt in question on account XXXX for XXXX XXXX. In response, they sent me one statement, but it did not provide sufficient evidence to confirm that I owed the debt. 

Following this, I called Jefferson Capital to request additional documentation to substantiate the debt. However, I did not receive any further information or documents. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a written follow-up request by mail, explicitly asking for the purchase agreement for the debt and requesting that the documentation be sent within 30 days. As of today, I have not received the requested information. 

I am seeking the CFPB 's assistance to address this issue and ensure that Jefferson Capital complies with my request for proper debt verification as required by law."
Credit card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"On XX/XX/year> I purchased a ring from XXXX and was heavily pitched on a credit card so I could purchase the more expensive item worth around {$5000.00}.

I set up automatic payments so the balance would be paid off within the XXXX  months and forgot about the card. I was never late on any payments and I was paying what I thought was the appropriate amount to pay the full balance by the XXXX month. XXXX months later I receive a notification from my credit report that I was charged over {$1400.00} on the card. I go to check the card and see that I was charged "" accrued '' interest because I had a small remaining balance at the end of the term. It turns out I miscalculated the dollar amount I should pay per payment and because of that I broke the terms of the promotion. Those terms were never properly explained to me by the salesperson. The only reason I paid this off in smaller amounts is because I thought I would not be charged interest. I would have paid the balance months ago or avoided the card altogether if I knew this could happen. I believe this is a misleading and predatory sales practice which tricked me into getting the card without knowing the full consequences. It is not fair I am paying more than ~ {$1400.00} for a mistaken ~ {$100.00} balance."

Portfolio Recovery Associates, as a debt buyer, has purchased very old debts that are far beyond the statute of limitations for collection. Despite this, they have deliberately misrepresented the dates these accounts were opened, falsely reporting them as recent. 

This calculated and deceptive tactic severely impacts my credit score. As bad debts age, they naturally lose their negative influence on credit scores, allowing individuals to recover financially. Portfolio Recovery Associates is fully aware of this and appears to manipulate reporting dates to unfairly damage my credit. This unethical strategy not only pressures consumers into paying debts they are no longer legally obligated to pay but also punishes them further by tarnishing their credit profiles. 

Adding to the injustice, these debts stem from the challenging XXXX years, a time when countless people faced unprecedented financial hardships. Instead of showing understanding or adhering to ethical collection practices, Portfolio Recovery Associates seems solely focused on exploiting this vulnerable period to unfairly extract money from consumers. 

This behavior is not only morally reprehensible but may also violate consumer protection laws. I demand that Portfolio Recovery Associates correct these inaccuracies immediately and cease engaging in practices that harm individuals who are already striving to rebuild their financial stability."

Debt collection,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XX/XX/2024 XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX Dear XXXX XXXX, I am writing in response to your letter dated XX/XX/2024, regarding my dispute of the alleged debt of {$660.00}, which you are attempting to collect. This letter follows my previous correspondence dated XX/XX/2024, where I disputed the debt and requested verification in accordance with my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). Specifically, I requested a copy of the signed contract associated with this debt, as well as a cease-and-desist from all collection activities, including reporting this matter to credit reporting agencies. 

Your response does not satisfy my request, and I believe you are in violation of the FDCPA. Let me address the issues in detail : Failure to Provide Verification You have failed to provide the proper verification of the alleged debt. In my initial request, I asked for a signed contract or agreement to substantiate the debt. Instead, you mailed me copies of monthly statements, which are not legally sufficient as they do not represent an agreement or contract between the parties involved. Under the FDCPA, it is an unfair and unconscionable practice to attempt to collect a debt that is not supported by a valid, signed agreement. 

Failure to Cease Collection Activity In addition, you have failed to comply with my request to cease and desist all collection activity, including the reporting of the alleged debt to consumer credit agencies. Reporting an allegedly disputed debt without proper verification and in violation of my rights is a deceptive and misleading practice under the FDCPA. Your continued reporting of this debt to credit bureaus, despite my dispute, constitutes a violation of the law. 

Furthermore, I am concerned that my personal information has been shared without my consent. This constitutes an additional violation of my rights under the FDCPA and applicable privacy laws. 

To summarize, I am requesting the following : Immediate cessation of all collection activity, including any further reporting of the alleged debt to any consumer credit reporting agency. 
Proper verification of the alleged debt, specifically a copy of the signed contract, as initially requested. 
Deletion of any and all credit reports related to this alleged debt. 
Failure to resolve these matters promptly will leave me no choice but to take further action, including filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and my state Attorney Generals office. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I expect your prompt and thorough response to my request. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX"

Mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,Confusing or misleading advertising or marketing,"Subject : Formal Complaint Regarding Deceptive Business Practices, Misrepresentation, and Lack of Transparency in Home Purchase and Loan Process To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to file a formal complaint against Lennar XXXX ( the builder ) and Lennar Mortgage ( the lending entity ) concerning the home purchase and loan process for the property located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX  XXXX ( Loan Number : XXXX ). Both companies are part of the Lennar Corporation, but I believe they have engaged in deceptive business practices related to the {$21000.00} rate buy-down credit, lack of transparency in the loan terms, and miscommunication between their departments. 

XXXX. Misrepresentation of {$21000.00} Rate Buy-Down Credit From the outset, Lennar XXXX ( through their sales representatives and loan officers ) misrepresented the {$21000.00} rate buy-down credit. This credit was initially presented as a straightforward incentive to reduce the interest rate on the loan. However, after signing the agreement and seeking clarification from the loan officer, I was informed that it was being treated as a promotional rate or bulk rate buy-down. These terms were never disclosed upfront and were explained with insufficient details, using terms such as off settlement, bulk buy-down, and XXXX, which are not industry-standard and remain unclear to the consumer. These terms were neither defined in plain language nor adequately explained in the documents provided. 

At the time of the agreement, I explicitly confirmed with the loan officer that the {$21000.00} credit would be applied toward the rate buy-down. This was a key part of my decision to proceed with the purchase. Yet, at closing, I learned that the credit was not applied as promised and instead, Lennar referred to it as a promotional rate, further complicating and confusing the matter. This misrepresentation violates the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ), both of which require clear and accurate disclosures of loan terms, including how any credits are applied. 

XXXX. Lack of Transparency and Potential Deceptive Practices Throughout the process, Lennar failed to provide transparency regarding the nature of the {$21000.00} credit and the rate buy-down. The lack of clarity surrounding the credits application raises serious concerns about potential deceptive practiceswhere a consumer is lured into an agreement under false pretenses, only to find that the terms change or are not applied as expected. 

The terminology used in communicationssuch as bulk rate buy-down, off settlement, NFC, promotional rate, and rate buy-downwas introduced inconsistently by various departments involved in this transaction. Each department seemed to use a different term, with XXXX word being added to each email without clear explanation or proper definition. These terms were never properly explained or clarified in plain language, leading to confusion about their meaning and impact on the loan terms. 

Sales department first introduced the term bulk rate buy-down. 
Loan department used off settlement. 
Legal team referred to it as a promotional rate. 
Each of these terms is neither clearly defined nor standard in the industry, making it difficult for an average consumer to understand. This inconsistent use of terminology, coupled with the failure to provide clear, plain-language explanations, exemplifies the lack of transparency that violates consumer protection laws such as XXXX, RESPA, and state-specific XXXX XXXX Acts. 

XXXX. Unreasonable Delay in Response and Lack of Resolution Despite numerous attempts to clarify these issues directly with Lennar, including written inquiries and formal complaints, I have received no satisfactory responses. After sending legal notices and escalating the issue to higher management, there has been no acknowledgment of the serious issues I raised, nor has there been an effort to resolve the matter. The lack of response from Lennar 's legal and corporate management teams indicates either a deliberate attempt to avoid resolution or a complete failure in their customer service process.

Furthermore, Lennars apology email, sent in response to my complaints, did not address the core issue of the misrepresentation of the {$21000.00} credit or the lack of clarity surrounding the loan terms. Instead, they simply apologized for the confusion without providing a substantive explanation or resolution. This apology, while seemingly conciliatory, is a clear admission of mishandling and confusion on their part. If no mistake had been made, there would have been no need for such an apology. The apology serves only as a deflection, rather than an actual resolution to the miscommunication and financial distress I have endured. 

This sidestepping of the original issue highlights Lennar 's failure to take responsibility for the misrepresentations and the severe financial and emotional strain they have caused. The lack of a legal or financial remedy in the apology shows that they are not addressing the real problem at handthe incorrect application of the {$21000.00} credit and the lack of clear, transparent communication surrounding the loan terms. 

XXXX. Impact on Financial and Emotional Well-Being As a result of these misrepresentations and the ongoing lack of transparency, my family has suffered emotional distress and confusion. The confusion surrounding the {$21000.00} credit, combined with the last-minute changes to the terms of the loan, forced me to make significant decisions under extreme pressure. This situation has caused undue financial strain, as well as emotional distress, as I was led to believe that I was receiving the agreed-upon terms and that the {$21000.00} credit would significantly reduce my loans interest rate. 

Furthermore, the continuous delays and lack of response have further exacerbated the anxiety and uncertainty regarding our familys home purchase. The constant back-and-forth without clear answers is unacceptable, especially given the financial implications. 

Applicable Legal Violations : Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : Lennar failed to fully disclose the terms and conditions of the loan, including the exact application of the {$21000.00} credit and the promotional rate. 
Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ) : The lack of clear documentation regarding the application of the {$21000.00} credit violates RESPAs requirements for transparency in settlement charges. 
California Consumer Protection Act : Lennar 's failure to disclose critical information regarding the rate buy-down process and potential bait-and-switch tactics may constitute deceptive business practices under state law. 
Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) Deceptive Advertising : Lennar may have engaged in deceptive practices by advertising the {$21000.00} credit in a way that misled consumers about its actual application and terms. 
State-Specific Breach of Contract Laws : The failure to fulfill the contractual promise of a {$21000.00} credit, which was a central part of my decision to purchase the home, may constitute a breach of contract under California state law.

Breach of Contract and Promissory Estoppel : Lennar promised a {$21000.00} credit, which I relied upon in my decision to proceed with the purchase. The failure to deliver on this promise constitutes a breach of contract. Under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, I suffered harm from their failure to fulfill their promise. 
Additionally, Lennar 's last-minute suggestions to withdraw the application raise serious concerns about their lending practices. If a lender is legally obligated to act in good faith and it suggests withdrawal under duress, it casts doubt on their adherence to fair lending practices."

In response, I only received collection letters, invoices for a different account that they claim as theirs, and a letter stating the purchase of the account, but without specifying the full account details ( FULL ACCOUNT NUMBER ) or the documents I had requested, such as the contracts that would allow MCM to collect this amount from me, for example."

They continued to HOLD my OWN MONEY, ignoring the instant payout selection I had made. They closed my account in MAY, but CONTINUED CHARGING ME {$15.00} x 7+ MONTHS for interest and late fees ALL THE WHILE STILL HOLDING MY MONEY AND REPORTING NEGATIVE/LATE PAYMENTS TO MY CREDIT! If thats not absolute crazy enough, SELF took {$100.00} from MY MONEY that they were holding, and PAID the SECURE credit card I held with them.

Despite my ongoing efforts to reach out and request a fair resolution, including settlement and potential forgiveness, no meaningful response has been provided by your company. This situation has become untenable, and I am seeking immediate action. 

Loan Details : - Original Loan Amount : {$11000.00} - Current Principal Balance : {$7900.00} - Past Due Amount : {$490.00} - Interest Rate : 13.75 % ( variable ) - Daily Interest Charge : {$2.00} - Last Payment Date : XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  - Monthly Installment : {$120.00} - Date of Loan Origination : XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  Issue Overview : Since the origination of this loan, I have made regular payments as required, and have accumulated a significant amount of paid interest. However, despite my efforts to work with your office regarding a settlement or potential forgivenessdue to my financial hardship and the mounting interest chargesthere has been no response or resolution from your side. 

To date, the interest alone has amounted to {$7800.00}, which, if added to the principal, significantly exceeds the original loan amount.

The series of events surrounding this repossession and subsequent actions by Hyundai Motor Finance have caused me significant distress and financial harm, and I am requesting your assistance in resolving these issues. 
Background and Details 1. Repossession Circumstances : Hyundai Motor Finance repossessed the vehicle without providing adequate confirmation to me, leaving me uncertain whether the car was taken by them or stolen, as the XXXX Hyundai XXXX is one of the most targeted models for theft due to its lack of a passive engine immobilizer. This vulnerability is a known manufacturing defect acknowledged by Hyundai in a class-action lawsuit settled for {$140.00} XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Although my late mother is eligible to participate as a class member in this lawsuit settlement I have been barred from representing my mothers interest and I want that rectified immediately. 
2. Communication Barriers : Despite notifying Hyundai of my mothers passing and initiating estate proceedings with the Probate Court of XXXX XXXX, Georgia, in XX/XX/XXXX, Hyundai refused to communicate with me regarding the repossession, citing privacy concerns. This was inconsistent with their prior willingness to accept XXXX payments from my checking account. 
3. Car Retrieval Issues : After weeks of effort, I retrieved the car from the XXXX Auction in XXXX XXXX, Georgia, at the end of XX/XX/XXXX. I was charged {$170.00} by XXXX and additional fees by Hyundai that were never itemized despite my repeated requests for a written breakdown. 
4. Vehicle Condition and Concerns : Upon retrieving the car : o It was significantly dirtier than when it was repossessed.

o The odometer showed an increase of XXXX miles. 
o Items such as empty snack bags and tissues were left inside, suggesting unauthorized use. 
o My phone was no longer the only device synced to the car. 
o The driver-side door handle is now loose and insecure, likely damaged while in Hyundais possession. 
XXXX. Outstanding Title and Reimbursement Requests : Despite assurances that the car title would be delivered within XXXX business days, I have yet to receive it nearly a month later. Additionally, I am seeking reimbursement for unauthorized mileage, repairs to the cars door handle, and compensation for Hyundais failure to safeguard the vehicle while it was in their possession"

I am seeking your assistance in investigating this matter and taking necessary actions to ensure that justice is served. Below are the details of the incident. 
1. Summary of the Incident : The first unauthorized transaction was made on XX/XX/year>, and posted on XX/XX/year>, approximately one week before I detected fraud. 

2. Timeline of Events : Initial Fraudulent Transaction : The first unauthorized transaction was made on XX/XX/year>, and posted on XX/XX/year>, approximately XXXX week before I detected fraud. 
Subsequent Transactions : Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/year>, a total of XXXX fraudulent transactions were made, amounting to approximately {$42000.00}. These transactions appeared in my account even after I raised an initial claim and canceled the card. 

Upon questioning why charges continued despite the cancellation, the bank informed me that these transactions had been kept "" pending '' and were later approveddespite clear signs of fraud. I subsequently raised XXXX claim cases to contest these charges. 
Action Taken by Me : Upon detecting the fraud, I immediately : I. Locked the card on XX/XX/year>. 
II. Contacted the credit card issuer to report the fraudulent transactions and raised total of XXXX disputes. 
III. Canceled the compromised card and received a replacement, which I have not activated, awaiting resolution of the issue. 
Banks Response : Despite mentioning the fact that I was over XXXX miles away from the fraudulent transaction locations, the bank rejected my claim. Their rejection was based on the assertion that the physical card was present at the PoS, which contradicts the fact that I have the card in my possession. 
3. Concerns with the Bank 's Handling of the Case : The bank failed to flag or block the suspicious activity during the week when XXXX transactions were made, including multiple high-value purchases and transactions exceeding my credit limit ( {$11000.00} ). 
Transactions were approved despite being geographically implausible, such as purchases made hundreds of miles apart within hours. 
The bank has demanded additional proof, such as video footage from merchant locations, which I can not procure. 
4. Evidence Available Physical Card : have retained the physical card. 
XXXX XXXX : The card statement confirms my usage in North Carolina, over XXXX miles away from the fraudulent transaction sites during the fraud period. I can provide XXXXXXXX XXXX  data upon request to further corroborate this. 
A record of communication with the credit card company regarding my claims and their subsequent rejection.

5. Impact on Me : The bank has held me liable for these fraudulent charges and is demanding payment, putting me at risk of financial and credit damage. I am deeply concerned about the potential misuse of my identity beyond this incident and fear further repercussions. 
Request for Assistance : I respectfully request your intervention in this matter to : Investigate the fraudulent transactions and determine how my card information was compromised. 
Hold the responsible parties accountable, including individuals or merchants involved in the fraud. 
Protect my financial and personal identity from further misuse.

Credit card,Getting a credit card,Application denied,"This is a follow-up complaint regarding my unresolved issues with American Express National Bank ( American Express ) . My original complaint ( No. XXXX ) was closed, but the company failed to address or resolve my concerns. I am resubmitting this complaint because American Express continues to violate my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ), Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), and Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ). 

Background : On XX/XX/2024, I applied for the American Express Platinum Card, and my application was denied based on a XXXX score obtained from XXXX. I informed American Express that the information in my consumer report was false and unverifiable. Despite this, the company : Relied on False Data Without Verification ( 15 USC 1681 ) : American Express based their denial on inaccurate consumer report data and did not provide the legally required verification method under the FCRA. 

Dismissed My Request for Compensation Without Justification : My original complaint included an invoice for {$49000.00} in damages caused by their actions. American Express refused to address it, failing to acknowledge their responsibility for the harm caused by their non-compliance.

Intimidated Me Through Repeated Denials ( 15 USC 1692 ) : American Express d
enied my application three times, most recently on XXXX XXXX XXXX, without addressing the core issues or taking corrective action. This repeated denial, based on the same false data, constitutes harassment and intimidation under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.

Shifted Responsibility to the Credit Reporting Agency : Instead of verifying the accuracy of the data they used, American Express directed me to dispute the inaccuracies with XXXX, violating their obligations under the FCRA. 

The Companys Misleading Claims : In their response, American Express repeated their claim : We are committed to making sure all creditworthy customers have equal access to credit. However, denying me credit based on false and unverified data contradicts this statement. Their failure to correct their decision or take responsibility directly undermines their supposed commitment to fairness and compliance. 

Relief Requested : Immediate Reversal of the Credit Denial : American Express must reverse their decision based on false and unverified data.

Disclosure of Verification Methods : The company must provide the method used to verify the consumer report information and justify their reliance on inaccurate data.

Compensation for Damages : I request payment of the {$49000.00} invoiced for damages caused by their actions and continued non-compliance.

Full Investigation into American Expresss Practices : Given their ongoing violations, I urge the CFPB to investigate American Express for their failure to comply with FCRA, ECOA, TILA, and UCC.

Conclusion : American Expresss repeated denials, reliance on false data, and refusal to take accountability directly conflict with their claim of fairness and equal access to credit. Their actions demonstrate a continued disregard for consumer protection laws. I request the CFPBs assistance in holding American Express accountable and ensuring that my rights are upheld.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer.

( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block.

( c ) Authority to decline or rescind.

( 1 ) In general.

( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title.

( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block.

( d ) Exception for resellers.

( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft.

( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information.

( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file.

( f ) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter"

Recently, I discovered that two different collection agencies are reporting the same debt of {$1800.00} across my credit reports from all three major bureaus. This dual reporting is misleading and has negatively impacted my credit score, which is a clear violation of my rights as a consumer.

Upon noticing this issue, I contacted both collection agencies, and each asserted that my debt was active, despite my explanation of the double reporting. To clarify, I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX, the original creditor, who confirmed that the debt was recalled from Sunrise Credit Services back in XXXX. Therefore, they are no longer authorized to collect or report this debt, yet they have continued to do so for over XXXX months. 

When I reached out to Sunrise Credit Services to address this issue, their management insisted that my account was still open and argued against my claims. They demanded that I provide documentation from XXXX XXXX XXXX, which is not my responsibility as a consumer. After further discussions with XXXX XXXX XXXX, their management assured me they would send a notice to Sunrise Credit Services to clarify that they no longer have the right to collect this debt.

I believe Sunrise Credit Services has violated the FDCPA in the following ways : - Section 1692e : Misleading representations about the debt.

- Section 1692f : Engaging in unfair practices by pursuing a debt that has been recalled.

These actions have severely affected my credit standing, limiting my ability to secure loans and adding significant financial stress.

I am requesting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's assistance in addressing this matter. Your agency has the authority to investigate and take action against unfair or deceptive practices in the financial sector. Any guidance or intervention you can provide would be greatly appreciated in helping me resolve this issue and protect my rights as a consumer. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and assistance."

Then said I qualified for MLA and they would need to apply it. In fact on their website it states, "" Credit must be acquired while on XXXX XXXX '' which it was and has been. 

Eventually, they conducted an MLA inquiry but denied my eligibility, claiming that my account, opened in XXXX, was not covered because MLA protections apply only to accounts opened after XX/XX/XXXX despite me being on XXXX XXXX in XXXX and currently still being on XXXX XXXX. However, when I consulted the U.S. XXXX Legal Assistance Office, I was informed that this interpretation is incorrect. According to the legal office, credit card companies were required to comply with MLA provisions for all relevant accounts starting from that period, regardless of when the account was originally opened. 

Additionally, I had no balance on the account until recently, which means all transactions I am being billed for likely occurred after XXXX. Any changes to terms or agreements made after that date should have been subject to MLA requirements.

My current loan term is interest reserve, and the loan is not due until XX/XX/XXXX. I was forced to sign a recording document in XXXX. Later I found out that they used the interest reserve money to pay me back as credit so that they could increase the loan amount in the next period and shorten the loan period as much as possible. The most outrageous thing is that they also charged me an exit fee. 
Their note documents were riddled with errors, including the loans maturity date. 
I paid the property taxes and insurance by myself for the past XXXX years, but they were charged in advance as part of the loan to increase the amount of my loan. But they never paid. 
When they knew I discovered their mistake, they tried to modify the document and coerce me into signing it. They gave me thirty days in the email to consider it and give me a new loan agreement. But before time came, they changed their mind again. First, they stopped giving me new loans, and then they tried to drag me down with a new contract. 
My current loan use my house as collateral. The real purpose of this loan company was to use various methods to increase the loan amount and finally take way my property. They are now putting pressure on me to foreclose my house. 

I need to get the legal aid.

I feel that I was pressured into purchasing unwanted add-ons such extended warranty that I did not need or want. The salespeople used aggressive tactics, such as : Implying that I would not be approved for the loan without the add-ons.

Stating that the add-ons were required by law or included in the price of the car.

Misrepresenting the cost and benefits of the add-ons.

I refused to allow myself to leave the dealership until I agreed to purchase the add-ons.

I believe that these tactics are unfair and deceptive, and I am concerned that they may have violated consumer protection laws. I am requesting that you investigate this matter and take appropriate action to protect consumers from similar practices. 

After the expiration of the extended warranty add-on, which cost me an additional {$20000.00}, my car began experiencing significant mechanical issues. Despite taking the vehicle to an authorized dealer, the problems could not be resolved. This resulted in substantial repair costs and considerable inconvenience. Ultimately, the ongoing issues and frustration led me to voluntarily return the car to the bank and cease making monthly payments. This unfortunate situation has also negatively impacted my credit score.

During the government-mandated shutdowns caused by COVID-19, my businessa source of incomewas completely shut down and unable to operate. In light of this unprecedented situation, I proactively reached out to Toyota Financial Services to explain my financial hardship caused by the natural disaster and proposed a resolution. 

I offered to pay the total price of the car, excluding the interest, and requested that Toyota Financial Services take back the car and close the account. They agreed to my proposal, accepted the payment, and repossessed the car. However, despite fulfilling this agreement, they subsequently reported the account as a foreclosure, which has negatively impacted my credit score.

This foreclosure report is unjustified because : 1. The financial hardship was caused by a government-mandated shutdown during a natural disaster.

2. Toyota Financial Services agreed to the proposed resolution, which included payment in full of the original loan amount ( excluding interest ) and repossession of the car.

3. The terms of the agreement were fully satisfied, and the foreclosure reporting is inaccurate and unfair under the circumstances.

As a result, I have had multiple payments wrongly applied as "" early payments '' on the minimum payment due each month instead of payments towards principal.

As a result, despite making payments +/- {$15000.00} towards my original loan, I still owe ~ {$24000.00} on a loan that originally was {$28000.00}. This is deceptive and predatory.

I intend to bring federal claims for these violations, I have offered correspondence to the company but, the company is not taking this serious at all, I can provide the derogatory response from WELLS FARGO COMPANY upon request.

This company is in difference with my position so I don't intend to play games with this financial institution, I reviewed what happened during Wells Fargo class action DATA BREACH LAWSUIT, the wells Fargo financial institution agent as well as their legal team is belligerent and non-compliant, I don't wish to experience this so, I am going straight to Federal District Court bringing claim of Securities Fraud, Consumer Rights Violations, T.I.L.A Violations etc.

I have yet to receive an answer to my correspondence about my stolen securities i have already received a response from a XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/year> noting receipt of my Notice but XXXX response to the matter. 

I sent the Notice to this XXXX XXXX and they received and signed for it on XX/XX/year>, today is the XXXX XXXX XXXX as you can see XXXX weeks have passed and no answer from the company. 
i alresdy know this company is stealing from me, I have all proofs and documented evidence and, I have provided this proof to the Financial Institution and all regulatory authorities so, I am proceeding with my Federal Claims in Federal District Court then the Supreme Court of The United States we will public since this seems like a joking matter to The Wells Fargo Company, any delays are unacceptable, I didn't shock this financial company and its agents with this claim, THEY ARE VERY AWARE THAT THIS IS NORMAL OPERATION AT WELLS FARGO, so It matters not how long this company takes to respond to my correspondence, tHE FRAUD HAD ALREADY BEEN COMMITTED, the fraud was committed when Wells Fargo and company denied me ( the consumer ) my right to extend my consumer credit, then again by your company claiming to be the original issuer of the note, then again when your company sent my note with its ACCOUNTS RECIEVABLE to the Federal and told the Board of Governors that I gave my securities to your company as a gift, LIES AND DECEPTION so therefore I am bringing claim in federal district court against WELLS FARGO & COMPANY and its agents."

- Upon catching up on payments, the apartment complex refused to accept my rent and subsequently took me to court. 
- We settled on a payment in court, and I paid a portion immediately, followed by monthly payments until I moved out. 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX 's Involvement : ** - Years later, XXXX XXXX contacted me, alleging I still owed a balance. 
- During my interactions with XXXX XXXX, their representatives were verbally abusive, threatening, and unwilling to work collaboratively to resolve the debt. 

XXXX. **Efforts to Settle the Debt : ** - I attempted multiple times to resolve the issue by offering a lump sum payment or a payment plan. 
- XXXX XXXX refused all reasonable settlement offers and did not provide a clear explanation for their refusal. 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX : ** - The original debt of {$XXXX} has ballooned to {$XXXX} due to accrued interest, making it even more challenging to resolve. 
- Despite my willingness to address the matter, XXXX XXXX aggressive and non-cooperative behavior has made it impossible to settle the debt fairly. 

XXXX. **Supporting Evidence : ** - I have attached relevant documentation, including proof of payments made to the apartment complex and court documents outlining the initial settlement. 

This experience has caused significant stress and hardship, as XXXX XXXX abusive tactics and refusal to cooperate have impeded my ability to resolve the matter. Additionally, their actions appear to violate ethical and potentially legal standards for debt collection practices.

Vehicle loan or lease,Getting a loan or lease,High-pressure sales tactics,"I went to the dealership in a very tough situation that required the necessity for 100 % financing. The finance person XXXX XXXX stated that because I needed 100 % financing my interest rate would be high. She further stated that no bank would approve me for a car with high miles because that was my initial request. She stated that they wanted me to be in an equity position, which I understood. I asked for the bottom line price and she stated that with a XXXX credit score, the payment would be XXXX including Gap. After I protested she explained that the interest rate was higher because of the 100 % and that overall with inflation interest rates are just high and that it is what it is. I asked if she tried XXXX XXXX which is my bank, she indicated that she did but they declined. She added that Credit Unions do not do 100 % financing for car loans. I didn't think anything of it because I know that XXXX XXXX  doesn't do 100 % on mortgages so I thought it was the same for car loans. I told her I wasn't comfortable. She told me to pay the loan for 6 months on time and I could return to refinance for something new or I can keep the car. Thinking that this was my only option I agreed. I told her that I didn't need registration and tags cause I was going to transfer them. She said I couldn't leave the lot unless I had those tags with me so I had to get it ( which was a lie ). I advised her that if I found out anything different I would return the car the next day. 

The next morning I found that my bank XXXX XXXX did not receive an inquiry which was later evidenced from the inquiry list on my credit report. I then went to my other credit Union ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and they not only thought the interest rate of 23.66 % was extremely high they informed me that they indeed do 100 % financing. The bank agreed to finance the loan and advised me to call the dealership to see if they would cancel the loan and let them finance it since it was done after banking hours and it hadn't been 24 hours. The bank also asked for the original purchase order. I called, the salesman who said to return the car and he would get a new purchase order for my bank. I returned to the dealership at approximately XXXX, and XXXX XXXX said it was too late that the bank had already processed the loan. I asked her how as it hadn't been 24 hours yet and the papers were signed after XXXX? She said because it was signed electronically it was final ; this was XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX I called the bank that the dealer processed ( Santander ), and they hadn't processed nor received my paperwork for the loan as they had no record of my SS #.. 

I then filed a complaint with he Attorney General 's Office and XXXX. I told both that the only resolution for me was to either cancel the loan and take the car back or cancel the loan and let me purchase it through my bank. I called the XXXX and advised him of what occurred with XXXX XXXX. I told him that I attempted to return the car and he said that it was too late and that the loan was processed. I then asked him to provide my bank with the original purchase order. He refused. He told me that they do not give that. He stated that my paperwork would suffice. I reiterated that they needed the original and that I wanted the window sticker. In the end, I gave the bank this number to explain exactly what they needed. The Bank Manager, XXXX XXXX called to advise that the XXXX was very rude and almost combative with their request. He did not provide the paperwork until XXXX called them. 

When I spoke to the XXXX I advised them that the loan was not processed. He said no We have already received the XXXX payment. I then spoke to my salesman immediately after and he advice that no check was received, this was XX/XX/year> @ XXXX They preyed on my situation and pushed for a loan painting it as my only option because of my circumstances. They further lied to me to make sure the paperwork was processed by Santander, preventing my bank from financing the loan at a significantly lower rate. The bank pulled my credit, and the score was XXXX points higher than with the dealership, and they have approved 7 % interest. 

I also have requested confirmation of the offers and or denials from the other Leanders who were contacted on my behalf. 

My ask is simple : stop this practice, cancel my loan with Santander and the GAP as it was signed under false pretenses, and allow XXXX to finance the car @ 7 %. 

I can be reached at XXXX any time."

He connected me to someone seemed like from Citicards ( # shown as Citi XXXX @ XXXX ), the lady asked me to confirm my personal infor in order to mail my new credit card. I now don't remember what infor she asked me to confirm.

After staying on the phone with XXXX XXXX for about XXXX min, that was almost XXXX XXXX  XXXX, I asked him why it took so long.

Mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"To Whom It May Concern : I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding the improper handling of my mortgage loan servicing by Castle & Cooke Mortgage, which has caused significant financial and emotional distress. Prior to XX/XX/year>, I maintained a flawless payment history with no late payments. However, since the servicing of my loan was transferred, I have been reported as having five late payments, all of which I strongly dispute.

Here are the key issues I have encountered : Improper Notification of Loan Servicing Transfer : I was not informed about the transfer of my loan servicing through electronic communication, phone calls, or other timely notifications. I only learned of the transfer when I received a collection call regarding a late payment. At the time, I was out of the country for my wedding in my wifes home country, which compounded the challenges of addressing this issue promptly. 

Mishandling of Payments : I requested automatic payment drafts to ensure timely payments, yet Castle & Cooke has repeatedly mishandled my requests, leading to unwarranted late payments. 

Failure to Address Disputes and Resolve Errors : Over several months, I have diligently attempted to resolve these issues by speaking with customer service representatives who seemed sympathetic and assured me that the late payments and fees would be reversed. However, the written decisions have consistently reaffirmed their stance without adequately addressing my concerns. 

Given these issues, I am requesting the following resolutions : Removal of all late payment entries from my credit report to restore my credit standing. 
Reimbursement of all late fees and penalties assessed due to these mishandlings. 
Transfer of my loan servicing to a different servicer to prevent further issues. 
The repeated errors, lack of communication, and failure to provide timely resolutions have caused significant harm to my financial and personal well-being. I believe that Castle & Cooke Mortgage has violated federal regulations and failed to meet the standards of care required of a loan servicer. 

I respectfully request the CFPBs assistance in ensuring that these issues are resolved promptly and fairly. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require additional documentation or information regarding my complaint. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter."

The representative who was being addressed as Sir and addressing me as Sir ( I did not get his name ) told me the account was closed on XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX  days ago ) after XXXX  months of no usage. I asked him why I wasn't notified that this account was being closed. His answer was that I was notified through a letter sent via XXXX without specifying the date the letter was sent. I told him I never received a letter and he let me know that it is not the company 's fault if the letter was lost in the mail ( I did not suggest this, I simply said I did not receive this notice ) and that it is my fault for not using the card for so long that the account was closed. I asked why I could not see that letter in the online system and was told his system showed the letter was sent via XXXX even though I was enrolled in Paperless, so it wasn't in the online system. I told him I was seeing multiple amounts on the website for current credit limit and that I was trying to make a purchase on the website. His only response to the available balances not matching on their website in different spots, multiple times, was that the account was closed by the bank and there's nothing they could do about that. He would not address the reason it still showed the {$900.00} still available in some places and repeated that it was not their fault if it was lost in the mail or some other reason I did not receive the notice, but they did send it out. I never received any notice that my account was being closed and I have had this account open with XXXX ( clothing store ) since XXXX. They filed XXXX  in XX/XX/XXXX, but the store in my city is still open. They did not close all of their stores nor go completely out of business. I told the representative that I know I have XXXX or XXXX  days to dispute this issue online or by writing a letter and he rudely provided me with the company 's mailing address. Things I found online suggested to file a complaint here for quicker and more accurate resolution. Since I did already contact the company via telephone call regarding this issue, I am filing this complaint. I expect my original account to be reopened so I can continue to make purchases there, wasn't notified that it was being closed, it affects my credit history length, and their systems don't apparently match since XXXX page shows {$900.00} credit available and another page shows {$0.00}. Their systems have had payment/balance issues in the past which is XXXX reason I started to just use my debit card in their stores, so this doesn't surprise me. If this isn't properly and fairly resolved with the original account re-opened, I will just stop giving the retailer my money."
Debt collection,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was result of identity theft,
Vehicle loan or lease,Managing the loan or lease,Billing problem,"I have two loans with two different banks, XXXX XXXX  and BMO, both for recreational vehicles. Each loan is a fixed rate loan charged a daily interest rate. My monthly payments for each are distributed between principle and interest each month and I am completely aware that interest will be higher than the principle contributions. My issue is specifically on how they apply payments made in excess of what is owed as the minimum payment. Example ; fixed rate loan is 7.49 % with a monthly payment of {$560.00}. With exception of maybe 1 or 2 months, each month I have made payments in excess of that minimum amount. The idea was to have those applied to principle however that is not how they are applying payments. They are taking the excess monies and applying it to interest charges and then reducing the minimum payment amount for the following month by the overage amount that was applied to the interest charge. They are not applying this to principle. This practice seems incredibly unfair. They are taking my money which would allow for me to reduce the principle balance and instead applying to what I would XXXX future interest owned. They are applying it to their own interest income and changing me interest on a higher principle balance that I paid extra to reduce. After speaking to both companies, I was told that I have to actually go online, call, mail in or go into a branch to be sure that my additional payments are being allocated to principle. In fact, the BMO representative read me their internal policy or talking points and it said, excess payments were to be applied to principle but he assured me that that does not happen. If I am making my required minimum payment and then additional funds are received at the exact same time, why are they not applying those funds to benefit the consumer vs. themselves. This feels like a very unfair practice and almost deceptive. In order for clients to understand that what they intended to be principle contributions are not actually being applied, they would have to review their statements AND call the bank to understand why their payments are reflecting either a lower or no payment amount. I was told by the representative that even if I requested a reallocation of funds to be applied to principle vs. interest that in his experience, these are denied. He said it would be unsuccessful but did offer to submit it. This does not seem like a process that benefits the consumer at all and lines the pockets of the bank instead. I have two loans that this has happened to me on. Please review for unfair and deceptive practices."

As a long-time customer for over seven years, I am deeply disappointed by the level of service I have encountered, particularly regarding a recent dispute I had with a merchant. 

On XX/XX/2024, I made a purchase through XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX website for a pair of sneakers. After waiting several days for my order, I discovered that it had been canceled without my knowledge, and I was never issued a refund. After trying to resolve the issue directly with Citibank for nearly two months, I learned that they had closed the case in favor of the merchant, despite my clear evidence that my order was canceled. 

CitiBank allegedly sent a notice regarding this decision through the app 's notice section ; however, I never received any such notification. Additionally, I submitted all proof demonstrating that the order was indeed canceled and that I was entitled to a refund. Despite this, CitiBanks dispute department failed to take my side or handle the situation appropriately, siding instead with the merchant.

I have uncovered issues with CitiBanks dispute handling that extend beyond my individual case ; many other customers have voiced similar complaints concerning their disputes with merchants. This pattern of unprofessionalism and poor service is unacceptable. The dispute department appears to lack the necessary competence and commitment to fairly resolve customer issues. 

I am requesting the CFPB 's assistance in addressing this matter. It is crucial that consumers are treated with respect and that credit card companies like CitiBank are held accountable for their actions. We deserve a banking experience that prioritizes customer service and transparency. 

Thank you for your attention to this serious concern. I look forward to your response and any actions you can take to improve the situation for myself and other consumers facing similar challenges.

Debt collection,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"Heres the revised version incorporating the new information : I am writing to formally request assistance in resolving an issue regarding a collections account erroneously placed on my credit report by Wakefield & Associates. The account in question pertains to a debt allegedly owed to The XXXX XXXX XXXX, initiated by Choice Recovery and subsequently placed by Wakefield & Associates on XX/XX/XXXX, in the amount of {$950.00}. 

To provide context, The XXXX XXXX XXXX initially engaged Choice Recovery for collection efforts on XX/XX/XXXX, regarding an instrument return. Following disputes with XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, the debt was resolved, and I was issued a zero balance receipt in XXXX. As a result, the collection account was removed from my credit report on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Despite this resolution, Wakefield & Associates reported a similar debt in XXXX, requesting documentation I had already provided during the initial disputes in XXXX.

This invoice was never shared with me prior, and I was not notified of any additional fees or balances owed after receiving the zero balance receipt in XXXX. 

Per the attached evidence, the sudden re-reporting of this alleged debt and the creation of a new invoice years later raise serious concerns about the accuracy and legitimacy of this claim. It is unreasonable for Wakefield & Associates to request re-submission of information I provided years ago to resolve this matter."

( listen to the calls, they're recorded. ) I have explained what happened over and over ( you never get the same person twice. ) In both cases I was told it would be turned over to fraud and it never is. When I call the check I find out that the person never did what they said they were going to do in elevating this to fraud and deception. Citi has been especially bad. They never called to even report suspicious activity. nothing stood out for a {$500.00} plus taxi ride?? Seriously? I have even suggested they credit companies talk to each other and see where it clearly does not make sense. Citi said they don't do that and one rep even said nothing could be done basically because it was in XXXX, but Cit is a global firm, so that doesn't make sense. I have a Citi Costco Executive Card."

CAPIO PARTNERS has resorted to false, misleading, and deceptive means in their collection efforts, thereby violating my consumer rights.

The loan has a fixed interest rate of 17.99 %, which I believe is unreasonably high and has caused significant financial hardship. 

Loan Details : - Lender Name : OneMain Financial Protection Bureau - Loan Amount : {$12000.00} - Interest Rate : 17.99 % ( fixed ) - Origination Date : XX/XX/year> - Payments Made : XXXX payments of {$370.00} as of XXXX Complaint Summary : Despite making consistent monthly payments since the loans origination, my current principal balance remains {$10000.00}, with the majority of payments being applied to interest rather than reducing the principal. This creates an unmanageable financial burden. 

Additionally, the high interest rate was not adequately explained when I accepted the loan, and I believe the terms may fall under predatory lending practices, given the lack of flexibility or alternatives offered by the lender despite my attempts to communicate financial hardship. 

I kindly request the CFPBs assistance in addressing this matter and ensuring fair treatment in the resolution of this loan.

On XX/XX/year>, Macys incorrectly charged my account {$2600.00} instead of the expected {$1200.00}, which caused my XXXX Bank account to overdraft.

Frustrated with the lack of resolution, I filed a dispute with XXXX XXXX  for the {$1400.00} payment, as I was uncertain how the funds were being applied. After XXXX resolved the dispute in my favor, Macys reposted the {$1400.00} as a balance owed on my account and subsequently closed my credit account without providing a proper explanation. 

This account closure negatively impacted my credit score. I have all the necessary documentation, including proof of the original {$1400.00} payment, the overdraft caused by Macys error, and communication attempts with Macys customer service.

I am requesting that Macys : Clear the reposted {$1400.00} balance.

Mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"An existing modification, forbearance plan, short sale, or other loss mitigation relief","Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to file a formal complaint against JPMorgan Chase and XXXX XXXX XXXX for their handling of my mortgage assistance application and subsequent predatory practices. 
My husband and I were owners of a business that was severely impacted by the pandemic. While we faced financial struggles as a result, we were not financially irresponsible. We submitted an application for mortgage assistance and forbearance to JPMorgan Chase, both via email and by personally delivering it to the bank. Despite this, JPMorgan Chase failed to review, process, or even acknowledge the application. This neglect is particularly concerning given that the bank was aware we were considering filing for bankruptcy due to our circumstances. 
Instead of fulfilling their legal obligation to review and respond to our application, JPMorgan Chase sold our mortgage to XXXX XXXX XXXX, a company with predatory practices. This sale appears to have been conducted in bad faith, allowing JPMorgan Chase to profit while avoiding their responsibilities under the law. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX, in turn, charged us daily interest on the loan for the duration of the forbearance period without proper disclosure. We were not notified of these interest charges until after we sold our home. This lack of transparency and the financial burden it created exacerbated the challenges we were already facing, forcing us further into financial distress. 
Both JPMorgan Chase and XXXX XXXX XXXX failed to meet their legal and ethical obligations : Failure to Process Application : JPMorgan Chase was obligated to review and either approve or deny our application for forbearance. Their neglect to do so constitutes a breach of their responsibilities. 
Lack of Disclosure by XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX failed to notify us of daily interest charges during the forbearance period, a violation of transparency requirements and consumer protection standards. 
Predatory Practices : The deliberate sale of our mortgage to XXXX XXXX XXXX appears to have been a calculated effort by JPMorgan Chase to profit at our expense, transferring us to a lender known for exploitative practices. 
The hardship of navigating bankruptcy, compounded by these actions, has caused significant financial and emotional distress. Both institutions leveraged legal loopholes to exploit our situation, underscoring the urgent need for stronger consumer protections for individuals in financial crisis. 
I am requesting that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and hold both JPMorgan Chase and XXXX XXXX XXXX accountable for their actions. Specifically, I urge the Bureau to : Determine whether JPMorgan Chase violated its obligations in failing to process our application. 
Investigate XXXX XXXX XXXX for its lack of transparency and predatory interest-charging practices. 
Enforce penalties and require restitution for the financial harm caused by these actions. 
Additionally, both lenders now refuse to close my accounts after our home has sold and the loan ( s ) paid off. Chase still says they hold the loan even though XXXX is the loan servicer. 
Thank you for your attention to this serious matter. 
Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"

The deadline for the first payment is XX/XX/year>. I was informed that if the payment setup was not suitable for me, I could decline the trial period and apply for a second review of a home preservation program to avoid foreclosure. 

I called Wells Fargo on XX/XX/year> ; XX/XX/year> ; XX/XX/year> ; XX/XX/year> ; XX/XX/year> ; and XX/XX/year>, to discuss my home preservation plan and explore better options between accepting the trial plan or making a lump sum payment to reduce my overdue balance so that I could have a manageable payment plan when I requested a second review of my home preservation program. 

On XX/XX/year>, during one of my calls to discuss these options, I was treated rudely by XXXX XXXX, a representative from Wells Fargo, who refused to verify her identity when I asked for her name and she insisted on having my Social Security number. I informed her that if she was going to be difficult, she could transfer me to a supervisor who would assist me. XXXX XXXX refused to verify her name because XXXX XXXX heard her correctly initially and said she would be happy to pass me along to a supervisor. Instead, she placed me back into the queue, where I waited for XXXX hour and XXXX minutes listening to an automated voice. 

I called back and spoke to XXXX XXXX, who spent almost XXXX hours with me. He informed me that XXXX XXXX XXXX, a representative from Wells Fargos executive office, would contact me with first-class service the day after Veterans Day on Tuesday, XX/XX/year>. XXXX XXXX asked what time would be best for her to call, and I replied that between XXXX and XXXX PM would be ideal. He assured me that XXXX XXXX would call at that time to discuss my home preservation plans so we could resolve the matter before XX/XX/XXXX. 

However, on XX/XX/year>, XXXX XXXX not only did not call me back to discuss my home preservation plans, but when I called back on XX/XX/XXXX, I was set up for another call with someone from the XXXX office to reach out after XXXX PM on XX/XX/year>, and again on XX/XX/year>, and XX/XX/year>. 

Each time, Wells Fargo failed to honor the callback, and I had to call back repeatedly to find out why and set up another appointment with no success. On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX PM, I spoke to XXXX XXXX, another representative. I explained that I had been informed by previous representatives that I could schedule a callback from the XXXX office at a convenient time that worked around my job hours, so I wouldnt get in trouble with my boss while discussing my mortgage during work hours. XXXX XXXX told me that Wells Fargo does not call customers back at the costumers convenience. He insisted that Wells Fargo calls customers on Wellsfargo 's own schedule and that they had received my complaints and would review my situation, getting back to me in XXXX  days from XX/XX/XXXX. I told XXXX XXXX that it had been over XXXX working days since I requested to speak with Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX about this issue and that this was unacceptable, especially since my mortgage account is about to be jeopardized by XX/XX/XXXX due to mishandling by Wells Fargo. 

XXXX XXXX did not seem to care and continued to say that Wells Fargo would review my escalation and get back to me in 10 days, reiterating that they do not call customers back at their convenience. 

I would appreciate assistance from the XXXX office before my trial period expires on XX/XX/year>, so I can be better informed about which direction to take regarding my mortgagewhether to make the first trial period payment before it expires or to decline for a second review to avoid going into foreclosure.

Key Issues Refusal to Accept Durable Power of Attorney ( DPOA ) : Capital One has sent me correspondence stating they do not or can not accept my legally binding DPOA. This refusal directly violates federal and state laws regarding recognition of legal documents, including but not limited to : UCC 3-306 : Right of a claimant to enforce interests in negotiable instruments. 
XXXX v. Agnitsch, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX Cir. 1978 ) : Enforceability of actions taken under XXXX. 
I am not requesting ; I am demanding that my legal document be recognized as valid. 

Failure to Reopen Accounts and Use Principals Interest to Offset Debts : As the Principal, it is my legal right to have my accounts reopened. The principals promissory note ( collateral security ) created the account, and the bank is using this as an asset on its books. This constitutes misrepresentation when labeling the Principal as a borrower, as banks are not authorized to lend their own credit. 

XXXX v. Market XXXX. Bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) : Contracts beyond a corporations power are unlawful and void. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX : Corporations have no authority to lend credit. 
Capital One is unjustly enriching itself from my financial instrument while refusing to reopen my accounts. 

Unjust Enrichment and Proceeds of Securitization : I hereby claim all proceeds derived from the securitization of my promissory note. Capital Ones practice of bundling and selling securities for profit without disclosing this activity constitutes fraud and violates : Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : Requires clear and conspicuous disclosure of material terms.

UCC Article 9-203 : Enforceability of security interests and proceeds derived therefrom. 
As the creator of the promissory note, I am the grantor and registered owner. I demand my rights be upheld. 

Violation of 12 U.S.C. 411 Lawful Money : Capital One must accept payments in lawful money as defined under 12 U.S.C. 411. The failure to disclose how the application serves as collateral security is a breach of federal law. 

Lack of Disclosure and Proof of Delegation Authority : Capital One has failed to disclose the monetization process of my note and to provide proof of delegation authority to impose liabilities on the Principal. This lack of disclosure violates : 15 U.S.C. 1639 ( TILA ) : Requirement for accurate disclosure of credit terms.

The method used to verify the accuracy of this collection account. 2. The name and contact information of the person or entity that provided the verification. 3.

As the collection agency did not provide validation, the continued presence of this account on my credit report is both inaccurate and non-compliant with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) 809 ( a ).

Debt collection,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"I HAVE ASKED PORFOLIO RECOVERY TO SHOW PROOF OF THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THEM AND THE ORIGNAL CREDITOR THEY SENT STATEMENT TRANSACTIONS WHICH IS NOT A PURCHASE AGREEMENT ALSO ITS REPORTING AS A CHARGE OFF PER THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE A CHARGE OFF IS CONSIDERED INCOME AND INCOME CAN NOT BE REPORTED AND A CONSUMER REPORT IF IT IS A CHARGE OFF WHY HAVE I NOT received A 1099C cancellation OF DEBT LAST THING THE DATES OPEN ARE ALL different which is inaccurate information being reported I am writing to formally dispute the charge-off account reported by [ Creditor 's Name ] under my name, account number [ Account Number ]. This correspondence serves as a notice of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 

I would like to bring to your attention that, under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), consumers have the right to dispute any information in their credit report that they believe is inaccurate or incomplete. I believe that the charge-off designation on my account is misleading and improperly represented for the following reasons : 1. IRS Conclusions on Charge-Offs : The Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) has concluded that a charge-off can be considered income to a debtor under certain circumstances. However, this should be reported accurately through a Form 1099-C ( Cancellation of Debt ) if applicable. To date, I have not received a 1099-C concerning this debt, which calls into question the legitimacy of the charge-off being reported. As such, it should not be treated as a completed transaction as it lacks adequate documentation. 

2. Reporting of Late Payments : The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that all information reported to credit bureaus must be accurate and reflect the true payment history. If [ Creditor 's Name ] has reported late payments leading up to the charge-off, I demand verification of these claims. If accurate payment history exists, it should not have been misrepresented as an accumulation of late payments leading to a charge-off. 

3. FDCPA Compliance : Furthermore, I would like to assert my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ). If [ Creditor 's Name ] or any collection agency that reports on this account has failed to provide adequate validation of the debt when requested, this can be deemed a violation of my rights under the FDCPA as well. 

Given these points, I request a detailed investigation into this matter. I ask that you provide documentation of the charge-off, proof that a 1099-C has been issued to the IRS, and verification of any late payments or outstanding balances. If you can not provide such documentation, I request that you immediately correct the reporting of this account with the credit bureaus.

Per 12 CFR 1006.34 ( c ) ( 4 ) ( i ), your failure to provide accurate and complete disclosure of all necessary information prior to furnishing details to consumer reporting agencies further substantiates the illegal practices you are engaged in. 

P.s. My NEXT letter will be a notification of my LOITS! So that you do not need for a legal dictionary, a LOITS notice is a Letter Of Intent To Suit! You BEST be PROVEN COMPLIANT to ALL requirements and standards of FCRA COMPLIANCE and also of the implemented CRSA enacted CDIA implemented Metro 2 Compliance mandates as well. I will demand verification that each employee at your firm which MIGHT have seen or conducted any business on the file you allege mine has been properly trained by a certified and qualified instructor of the Metro 2 data field formatted reporting standards. I am NOT shy in detailing my DOUBTS you can withstand the requisites to survive a court hearing versus me as I leverage your DEFICIENCIES for a slew of victories being awarded a minimum of {$1000.00} PER VIOLATION PER TIME, and there certainly appears to be a bucket full. So, lets do this! Anything OTHER than your letter describing to me that you have already begun or completed the annulment of these unproven claims versus me and have eradicated ENTIRELY any and all aspects of records of what you allege being mine ( yeah! ) will IMMEDIATE compel me to assume your hostile to my demands of proper reporting and I will assume that your ignorance of appropriate and adequate duties are willful and intentionally injurious. Being such, civil suits are obvious however criminal charges are not out the question, particularly if your chicanery-led subterfuge brings forth or allows."

When I purchased this phone I went straight home, plugged it in & it showed liquid in the charging port error & wouldnt charge. I went right back to the store, they couldnt duplicate the problem so they said it must be my cord. I bought a new cord. Periodically I had that issue. Ive had nothing but problems with this phone.

This was a bad phone from day 1 and if they would have exchanged it when I took it back an hour after I bought it I would have a reliable phone. So, I thought Ill stick it out until I can replace it when my upgrade period is in effect. WRONG. The representative that did my contract did not do what I asked for and did not give me the upgrade option for the first time since Ive had AT & T cell service. I think that is their fault because they should have replaced the obvious defective phone when I took it back & written the contract the way I requested.

They did not notify me that they did this, even my contact email address was changed inside of my account when I went to access my account in early XXXX. I have gone over this again and again with Barclaycard representatives and they are now ignoring my request for proof, I have asked for the voice records from early XXXX where the representative told me that they were cancelling the card in question and issuing me a new card. This was due to suspicious activity on my card and a month prior to the fraudulent charge at a XXXX in Kansas by a XXXX XXXX, an unknown person to me, an unauthorized person. My data was leaked in a data breach earlier this year by a health care company and apparently my sensitive information is now on the dark web as this is the only place that someone could have gained access to it. 

I have also requested any voice records where someone may have impersonated me, and or the computer IP address from where such information was entered to gain access to my credit card. Barclaycard never contacted me to ask for permission to add someone to my card, they never contacted me that they had added a complete stranger to my credit card account. I have made numerous calls to address this and they keep ignoring the fact that they cancelled the card in early XXXX and issued me a new card and added a complete stranger to my account without ever notifying me. This is complete negligence in security and has caused me hours of my time trying to reason with incompetent employees from Barclaycard. They have sent me notices that they will have a manager call me within 48 hours and no manager has called. They sometimes tell me that they have called, but not one caller Id number on my phone says Barclaycard, and they have never left a message to notify me that they called, so that I can call them back. 

I pay my card in full each month, I have disputed the charge and told them that I am not paying for this fraudulent charge nor any of the interest they are now accruing on my account due to this fraudulent charge. This has affected my credit score and has caused me an enormous amount of time, yet they are not providing any resolution."

Mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Changes in loan terms during or after closing,"On XX/XX/year>, I received my closing disclosure that had all the final numbers that were approved by other departments. The loan amount was {$300000.00} and the total monthly payment was {$2100.00} and the closing costs were {$4700.00}. I agreed with these numbers and signed the disclosures and shortly after I received a call from Freedom Mortgage closing department and they were eager to set the appt for closing. During the call the lady informed me that we would be using a notary who would come to the house at XXXX XX/XX/year> to sign all the documents. After the date was set the lady from the closing department asked me to grab a pen and write down information about what figures I should expect for closing. She confirmed that the loan amount, rate, term and total monthly payment would be exactly what was on the disclosure I signed early that day ( same day XXXX ). Friday the XXXX of XXXX comes around and at XXXX the notary lady arrives and I welcome her into my home to sit and sign the documents. While she was getting to the final disclosure she made a point to remind us to review it to make sure nothing had changed since it has for her in the past. Immediately I noticed the loan amount had gone higher to {$300000.00} ( {$4500.00} difference ) and the mortgage payment had gone higher as well {$2400.00} ( {$350.00} difference ) and the closing costs was higher too! It had gone higher to {$9000.00} ( {$4300.00} difference ). Once I saw this I immediately called Freedom Mortgage and explained the difference I seen and the lady could not explain why the values had increased but she assumed it was because of a delinquent account somehow but I explained that we are at the table with the notary lady ready to close and that it would have been impossible for us to have gotten this far if we had any delinquencies associated with this account. She agreed but was unable to assist. She informed me to sign and we can figure it out later and I absolutely denied that action. I kindly asked the notary lady to leave our and we will figure out whats going on. After a few hours of hearing nothing back from Freedom Mortgage we received a call from XXXX in Closing Recovery who was very rude and deceptive. He said he called just to check in with me and congratulate our closing but I informed him we did not close and he immediately started to explain the difference in the loan amount vs what I was show and signed against what was presented at closing and he starting saying that it was because of my property tax and because we have a bill for {$4800.00} in taxes that they had to increase our escrow making my payment increase and that this was the only difference in the loan. First off, notice how he was just checking up on me but then immediately knows the issues that we are having and has all our records up on his computer, very deceiving. I explained that taxes were clearly included on the closing disclosure from the XXXX of XXXX, the last one I signed until closing. He said that it was human error on their side of things because they were calculating our taxes at less than {$1000.00} when in reality our taxes are {$4800.00}. To this I tried to plead our case, Freedom mortgage had made a mistake and it wasnt caught by the underwriting or loan officers or the escrow team and that we were presented numbers and was called and they confirmed their numbers for closing but on the day of closing everything changed and that we were not notified of any changes. XXXX admitted that they made a mistake, not only by not honoring what was presented to us by the loan department ( closing disclosure XXXX ) but also because they did not notify my by email like they should have to make sure that I was aware before closing. Instead they just sent a random lady into my house with higher numbers than what was promised/presented and expected us to just sign and not ask questions. All of this has been the worst experience in my life, I planned on closing the XXXX of XXXX and not having a payment for the months of XXXX and XXXX. Every day except for the weekends I called the freedom mortgage line and asked to speak to someone in hopes to figure out what is going to be done to get back on track and every time I was treated like absolute garbage. I was hung up on, I was yelled at, I was placed on hold while they spoke to each other to get the scoop on what the situation was, and I know this because every time I called in they asked me to verify my account and then they would immediately put me on hold and then after 5 minutes would come back on the line and say the exact same thing as XXXX, its the taxes. Every time I called in I asked to speak to a manager and every time I was told no one was available, they would take a message and have someone call me back but of course no one ever did. Im going on 3 weeks of dealing with this and still no one has called me back. To make matters worse, I received another closing disclosure after the closing fell through and it was even higher!!! How the XXXX does any of this make any sense!!! I feel deceived and no one should ever be treated the way I have been, but worse than all, no one should ever be told that their loan amount will be something and then on the day of closing have the numbers be completely different with out notice. I want something to be done about this, Freedom mortgage is a deceiving mortgage company that thinks they dont have to disclose any information until your sitting down at the closing table, I know thats not lawful. I know that they can not out right lie about what your loan amount will be, or change your taxes, or your closing costs at the last second! Someone needs to stand up to these corporate bullies, Im a XXXXXXXX XXXX  veteran that served for my country and I will not be treated like this."

I have no relationship with Midland Credit Management. My account was sold to Midland Credit Management after being denied a payment negotiation with Citibank.

Since filing a complaint with CFPB, Midland Credit Management stated that they would put me on a payment plan under the conditions that I sign a contract. This happened XX/XX/year> I then made a counter claim through CFPB for {$1500.00} in XX/XX/year>. However, my case with CFPB was closed. In XX/XX/year>, I contacted Midland Credit Management and spoke with a paralegal and offered the {$1500.00} settlement to them directly. I was denied and told that I needed to pay over {$8000.00} to settle. 

In addition, Midland Credit Management has attempted to contact me without properly identifying themselves. Each time they have called, they have asked if they were speaking with me. My response has always been may I asked what you are calling in reference to, and they have always said it is a private matter. Midland Credit Management is trying to manipulate me into giving information so they can trap me into agreeing to pay something to them. They also have used intimidating language such as wage garnishment and they are cruel. 

I learned that if a consumer has a {$600.00} debt or more, the debt can be cancelled and used as income per 1099-c code, which is something I am willing to do. However, I was still denied. Now, I have to appear in court on XXXX. 

This year, I have a had a decrease in income. In addition, I no longer have housing. I have temporary housing. This debt is cumbersome and has added to my stress. I have been affected mentally and physically. 

If I am not able to get a fair settlement, I fear that my wages will be garnished or that I may have to file bankruptcy.

Today : XX/XX/XXXX - no response to application for mortgage assistance, no package or next steps necessary to save my home from foreclosure. 

I am behind XXXX {$2700.00}, XXXX {$2700.00}, XXXX {$2700.00}. I can pay XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX in full. 

I am writing in desperate need of help in trying to get mortgage assistance that has been offered as I am in default right now with this lender. This lender will Not accept partial payments on my mortgage monthly payments. I am currently 60 days late, and have applied for some mortgage assistance with them. They are stating that I only can have a COVID 19 Owner Occupant Loan modification ( but I have not received this paperwork to look at ). I qualified for this mortgage with a 3.25 % interest rate. And instead of offering me ( single mom/debt to income ratio high ) ; a payment deferral, or a repayment plan, that "" allows you time to bring your mortgage current without having to make a single lump sum payment ''. They instead want me to restructure my loan which would cause me to fall even into a worse position with a higher interest rate. I think you should know that this loan servicer, LoanCare, immediately wants to inspect property when you are just 30 days late on your mortgage, they send someone out to your home. They refuse partial payments that could really help get money into the escrow account to at least cover insurance and interest. And that is disastrous. They state that if you send partial payments, that they will be sent back and your loan will be put into default ( where mine is ), and then finally foreclosure. 

And they say they appoint someone as your "" mortgage resolution advocate '' - who never calls, emails or writes a letter to try to assist. I have not heard one word from XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  XXXX XXXX ). Instead I have received a Notice of Default since submitting my application for relief. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, they stated Next Steps : "" We will begin processing your COVID XXXX Owner Occupant Loan Modification immediately and within approximately 15 days and you should expect to receive the offer and all of the instructions required to accept it. After 15 days from XX/XX/XXXX what I have received is a Notice of Default, and not a Owner Occupant Loan Modification. 

So, after wasting my time and having me fill out a mortgage assistance application and customer service reassuring me that the loan is in a protected status, they send a scary letter out instead telling me to cough up {$8300.00} and that I have the right to cure the default on or before XX/XX/XXXX. I will attempt to make my XXXX payment of {$2700.00} in whole on XX/XX/XXXX so I am not past 60 days late. But I could sure use an offer for deferred repayments right about now before come snatch my townhome from us. 

It does not seem like that is anything close to mortgage assistance. 

My reasons for falling behind are from huge home repairs that really should have been caught by the inspection when I bought the home. The plumbing upstairs was leaking in the wall of the second bath down to my dining room, and my furnace went out, then my car engine blew ( for a car that was paid off ) ; and I had to finance a vehicle which then added a {$500.00} payment monthly to my household. I am also under alot pressure for medical bills for my younger son and myself. I am heading into some medical testing ( biopsy procedure ) for potential XXXX. I got into a car accident in XXXX which also set me back. But the hardest thing began with my loan servicer LoanCare increasing my payment by almost {$300.00} due to what they say was an increase in the escrow homeowners insurance rates, from {$2400.00} to {$2700.00} ( roughly ). Neither the lender, nor XXXX XXXX XXXX, could even let me know that was going to happen. So, the home repairs, that increase and then also the mortgage insurance is $ XXXX. LoanCare tells me that they will not take the mortgage insurance off of the payment. I have friends that are telling me that it should have come off a year after my loan began? 

So either way they get my house, and if I default they get to have the home, and all while I pay a mortgage insurance that also guarantees money and property to them if I default and this pays them also? This does not make sense to me. 

I have documentation to prove all of these costs. The totalled car, the home repairs, the increase of house payment, and the mortgage insurance. Oh and my current car almost got repossessed in XXXX and that was what hindered me from making XXXX 's payment. 

There has to be a way to request a payment deferral with them, "" Defer repayment of XXXX or more past due principal and interest payments as a non-interest bearing balance, which will be due and payable at the maturity of the mortgage loan or earlier upon the sale of the property, refinance of the mortgage loan, or payoff of the interest-bearing unpaid principal balance. 

Can you help me? Surely the federal government would like me to stay in my town home, keep my 3.25 % interest rate I worked hard to earn, and the money I put down for this home was the only money that I received from my mother 's trailer home sale. She died from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and from then on, I have struggled to finally become a homeowner. I have come into some really hard circumstances XXXX right after another. 

I can not see the advantage to FHA to get me into some outrageous restructuring of my mortgage when I put money down $ XXXX of my mother 's money, and earned an interest rate of 3.25 %. Me and my XXXX sons, my dogs and my cat will have nowhere to go that we can afford here in the XXXX area. 

I have a lot of attachments for this situation, bills/etc coming. But the fact of the matter is that I have a good job, I just need time to catch up my payments and pay XXXX payment twice per month to help me. Beginning XX/XX/XXXX {$2700.00} ( XXXX XXXX ) ; XX/XX/XXXX {$1300.00} ; XX/XX/XXXX {$1300.00} ( XXXX payment ). XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX Bonus {$2700.00} ( XXXX payment ). XX/XX/XXXX, {$2700.00} XXXX payment. 

And that would catch me up to making the XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX.

These were large charges within a few hours from a company we never done business with before, in a foreign country. Chase should have flagged that.

We can never actually get the person we are supposed to talk to when we call. And of course several call disconnects during the process.

In XX/XX/2024 we sold the house in XXXX, which gave me {$400000.00} in cash to put towards my mortgage on my XXXX XXXX home, financed with Provident Financial. 

On XX/XX/2024 I called Provident Financial to inquire how to recast my loan. They instructed me to send a check for the amount that I wished to pay down to the principal, with a note that I wished to recast the loan. They also instructed me to pay a {$300.00} fee towards interest as a fee for the recast. I sent a check to Provident Financial for {$370000.00} to pay down my principal for the recast. Then I went online and made a {$300.00} payment towards interest for the recast fee. 

On XX/XX/2024 I wrote an email to Provident Financial to inquire about when the recast would happen. The response was exactly "" Our recast department has been notified that you would like to proceed with a recast. They will draft your recast agreements that outline the new payment terms of your loan and once completed, these arrangements will be made available under the "" Letters and Monthly Statements '' tab of your online account. Please print, wet-sign, both original documents to : Provident Financial XXXX XXXX' On XX/XX/XXXX I wrote Provident Financial again to inquire on the recast.

'' Now I am forced to either re-finance with a new mortgage company or pay XXXX XXXXXXXX on my home loan. I can not afford to continue paying this high payment for my mortgage loan. At the onset I was informed that a re-cast would occur once an investor was assigned and I would be allowed to recast. 

I would not have purchased a loan with Provident Financial if I knew they would sell my loan to someone else who does not re-cast. It seems shady an underhanded that they would sell the loan less than 6-months old to a company who does not allow the same procedures as they do."

Vehicle loan or lease,Managing the loan or lease,Billing problem,"Flagship Credit Acceptance LLC XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, PA XXXX Subject : Response to Complaint Review and Request for Release of Vehicle Title Dear Flagship Credit Acceptance LLC, I am writing in response to your XX/XX/year>, communication regarding my complaint filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). While I appreciate your acknowledgment of my concerns, your response contains inaccuracies and omissions that merit further review. 

Legal Breaches and Violations 1. Predatory Lending Practices under the Federal Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) TILA ( 15 U.S.C. 1601-1667f ) mandates clear and accurate disclosure of loan terms, including finance charges, annual percentage rates ( APR ), and fees. However, your internal risk assessment model and the terms of my loan reflect disproportionate interest rates and fees inconsistent with the standard market for borrowers in my credit category. 
Hidden Fees : Despite your assertion that no hidden fees exist, the compounding of extensions and associated costs demonstrates a lack of clarity, constituting a failure to provide the material disclosures required under 12 C.F.R. 1026.17.

Excessive Late Fees : The late fees imposed ( 10 % of the unpaid amount, with a {$5.00} minimum ) may exceed state usury laws, depending on the specific terms disclosed in your contract. Excessive penalties that are arbitrary or disproportionate to actual damages are prohibited under TILA.

2. Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) Violations The ECOA ( 15 U.S.C. 1691-1691f ) prohibits discriminatory practices in credit transactions. By placing bureaucratic obstacles on my requests for a loan modification and due date adjustment, you effectively denied me equal access to amend the loan terms despite my good-faith efforts to resolve the account.

I contacted Flagship on multiple occasions to request both a loan modification and deferred payment, but these efforts were met with resistance. Your failure to provide these options as promised violates contractual good faith and fair dealing principles.

3. Allocation of Payments and Failure to Disclose Payment Application Your response notes that the allocation method used is common to consumer finance companies. However, the lack of transparency regarding how payments are applied ( principal vs. interest vs. fees ) violates TILA disclosure requirements ( 15 U.S.C. 1639 ). This omission prevents me from effectively managing my repayment obl

igations. 4. State Lien Law and Contractual Good Faith Breaches State lien laws typically require lenders to act in good faith when enforcing security interests. Your refusal to waive late fees or offer reasonable modifications, coupled with threats of repossession, undermines the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing inherent in all contracts. According to UCC 9-610, secured parties must act in a commercially reasonable manner when enforcing security interests. The refusal to accommodate reasonable requests for modifications or deferments, particularly during financial hardship, may be deemed unreasonable under state law. Request for Title Release and Additional Remedies Given the breaches outlined above, I request that Flagship : 1. Release the vehicle title free and clear. Flagships practices, as described, fail to comply with federal and state laws governing loan disclosures, payment application, and equitable modifications. 2. Provide an accurate accounting of all fees and interest accrued to date, with an explanation of their compliance with applicable laws. 3. Cease repossession threats immediately. Any repossession actions without addressing these issues will constitute unlawful seizure under state law. 
I trust that Flagship will recognize its obligation to resolve this dispute in good faith. Please respond to this letter in writing within 14 days."

The lender refuses to offer me an affordable settlement option for this account. I have repeatedly asked for a 48-60 month repayment term to no avail. I continue to be in financial hardship, and am willing to make a deal with this lender to get this account repaid. However, the settlement offer this lender has offered to me requires three significantly high payments, which I simply can not afford."

Incorrect Addresses : I disputed nine invalid addresses that do not belong to me, requesting their removal from my credit report. 
Incorrect Employment Information : I requested the removal of "" US Fed Benefits, '' which I have never been affiliated with as an employer. 
I also provided supporting documentation, including a copy of my valid ID and proof of my correct address, to facilitate Equifax 's investigation. Despite this, Equifax failed to address my dispute within the 30-day legally mandated timeframe under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). This deadline was XX/XX/year>. 

On XX/XX/year>, I sent a 15-day follow-up letter reiterating my requests and urging Equifax to comply. Finally, on XX/XX/year>, I sent a final demand letter after receiving no response from Equifax. 

Equifax eventually responded on XX/XX/year>, only after I filed a complaint with the CFPB. While Equifax deleted the disputed addresses and the employment information, they failed to correct the name issue by retaining the inaccurate name "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' on my credit report, despite having received proof of my correct name. This failure to comply within the required 30-day timeframe and provide complete corrections violates multiple sections of the FCRA, including Sections 607 ( b ), 609 ( a ), and 611 ( a ).

Vehicle loan or lease,Managing the loan or lease,Billing problem,"One ( 1 ) year ago ( roughly ) NMAC / Nissan failed to bill my new bank in XXXX of XXXX, after switching the second of two vehicles over from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Nissan in XXXX of XXXX, Submitted for payments to both banks creating a double-payment ( double autopay ) unbeknownst to me at the time. These affect accounts have never been the same since. We have two vehicles both XXXX XXXX 's on of which generally bills on or around the XXXX of each month for a total sum of {$320.00} and the other, on or around the XXXX of the month, for a total sum of {$320.00}, until the discrepancy at hand. Several checks were bounced and what was not included was the times retried which also assess fees. At this time we are just seeking to make our statements correct by not only adjusting their own fees charged in the amounts of {$20.00} and {$16.00} making it look like they are due at any given time {$350.00}, when that isn't the entire picture. There is interest I am certain that the additional {$36.00} has incurred and we would like that also to be accounted for as well and for this account not to be charged anything more than we would have originally had this issue not happened. Back to the initial root of the problem at hand. The double automatic payment occurred when Nissan submitted and both banks remitted payment in the month of XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX Nissan aka NMAC received # XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX -- the new bank on XX/XX/XXXX, and then on XX/XX/XXXX, they also received {$320.00} from the old bank, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX as well, causing a double payment. But the did not stop there. for XX/XX/XXXX, they tried to collect again, but from the former bank, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, which already hit with fee both from being presented with payments that could not be covered and from the accounts billed that could not collect from funds depleted from the additional withdrawal. Upon noticing this, XXXX XXXX  XXXX agreed to recall their payment that had gone through the previous month on XX/XX/XXXX, once they knew about the XX/XX/XXXX payment having already been taking by the new XXXX XXXXXXXX. When they recalled this payment which should have left everything even/correct except for their next pending payment on XX/XX/XXXX, that had not yet cleared ; the reversing the XX/XX/XXXX payment, then caused the pending XX/XX/XXXX that had not completed its posting for XX/XX/XXXX to be dropped. This also would not have been an issue, had Nissan / NMAC submitted payment to the new XXXX XXXX like they did the month prior ( when they established autopay with the new bank ) ; but when XXXX did not initially receive a request for payment per the autopay set up, so they did not fulfill sending one, which is why we went from having a double payment in XX/XX/XXXX, to having no final payment on record initially for XX/XX/XXXX. This was rectified as soon as we realized there wasn't a payment official for the month of XX/XX/XXXX. But that was not due to our neglect. We had set everything up the same on both accounts, and the account that gets billed the XXXX of each month in the amount of {$320.00} had a smooth transition from the first to the second bank -- unlike with the 2nd vehicle whose payments post the XXXX of each month for the amount of {$320.00}. We had no idea what would happen next, whether or not early on if a payment was coming through to the new bank ; and we had been spending all of our time trying to cover all of the bounced items one their first postings or second postings and those fees were putting us further in the hole."

I tried at least 12 times -using a variety of communication methods such as certified mail, phone conversation, email, and court- to obtain this information from : 1. The lender Wilmington Trust , National Association. 
XXXX. The servicer XXXX XXXX. 
3. The debt collector XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
4. IRS. 
XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
6. Florida Department of Revenue.

All of these attempts were unsuccessful. I have been trying for a whole year. 
If I do not get this information in next couple weeks, I can be accused of a federal bankruptcy fraud crime.

Here is what happened : 1. I wanted to sell my condo when I became ill and was 6 weeks behind in my mortgage payments. I asked my ex-husband to help. 

XXXX. My ex looked at my loan applications which were submitted on my behalf by my landlord at a time ( who has been a long time condo board member and licensed realtor ). He discovered that my condo address was changed during the loan origination by the seller entering a new building number for my condo. My title report was forged and it was not shown that there is a mortgage on whole building and land, and open mortgage from the former owner on the condo unit which I was buying in the building. My ex told me that government can forfeit my condo because false info was submitted to bank. 

3. I notified the mortgage servicer on XX/XX/XXXX about the fraud and sent evidence of fraudulent loan applications and changed property address.

4. Mortgage servicer, instead of putting me in a nonmonetary default for fraud in the borrower 's application, as it is required in my mortgage contract, waited until I am eligible for a monetary default for failure to make mortgage payments, and started the foreclosure proceedings then. 

5. Three days after the foreclosure complaint was filed in XXXX XXXX XXXX court on XXXX XXXX, my condo was sold to the condominium XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX Our condominium operates as a special purpose entity due to being a historic-contributing property in XXXX XXXX XXXX Every time there is a sale, it is first sold to condominium, and the condominium sells the condo to a new owner. This is a double escrow scheme where a separate deed with the county recorder is not recorded at a time the condo is sold to the condominium. Condominium doesn't pay state or federal taxes due to being part of conservation easement syndicate in XXXX XXXX and the sale taking place with the help of the infinite banking insurance entity XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

6. Wilmington Trust secured the summary judgement from the court and scheduled the sale of my condo on XX/XX/XXXX. 

7. The summary judgement order was written by Wilmington Trust lawyers XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as it was ordered by the judge for them to upload the order into the court system. The summary judgement order changed the contract terms where the interest rate was changed and times when those interest rates were charged were also changed. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX filed three different summary jud

gement orders with different amounts showing as owed. 8. Under Florida law, both the lender and the borrower are liable for the unpaid taxes. I wrote to IRS and Florida Department of Revenue asking to clarify what I owe but have not heard back.

9. I didnt receive the tax forms from the mortgage servicer for the year of XXXX. So I am not sure if IRS was paid for the mortgage interest income. 

10. I filed a bankruptcy petition with the XXXX Florida XXXX XXXX. But I have no idea what I owe to Wilmington Trust and to IRS and the Department of Revenue because there are at least 3 different versions filed by Wilmington Trust , National Association in the public records. 

11. I called and wrote to Wilmington Trust and XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX many many times, asking for - 1.Explanation on which dates which interest rate was charged.

2.Title Search Report.

3.Evidence that IRS taxes were paid for interest charged in XXXX. 
4.Proof the documentary taxes were paid to Department of Revenue.

5.Proof the court cost taxes were paid.

6. Explanation why the lawyers filed another document in court for over XXXX dol in legal costs 2 months after the final judgement was entered when the case was closed and there were no legal actions being taken such as appeal or rehearing. I was a pro se litigant in my foreclosure case. 

I found 250 email addresses of Wilmington Trust executives and emailed them all my questions but no one responded.

Tomorrow is my first hearing in bankruptcy court and I am scared the judge will accuse me of bankruptcy crime when they see that my petition has inaccurate numbers on mortgage and taxes debt, and all because Wilmington Trust and XXXX XXXX ignored my begging to provide clarification... help..."
Credit card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"Complaint Details What Happened * On XX/XX/year>, I booked a car rental reservation through American Express Travel with XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX. 
* The agreed rental terms were as follows : * Pick-Up Date/Time : XX/XX/scrub> XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Drop-Off Date/Time : XX/XX/year>, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Rental Location : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Confirmation Number : XXXX * Approximate Price : {$1300.00} ( including taxes ). 
* However, I was charged {$2500.00}, which is significantly higher than the agreed amount and was not authorized by me. 

First Dispute Resolution * Account Ending : XXXX * Reference Number : XXXX * Merchant Name XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  * Transaction Amount : {$2500.00} * Dispute Outcome : American Express denied my dispute, claiming the charge was valid. 

Second Dispute Resolution * Account Ending : XXXX * Reference Number : XXXX * Merchant Name XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Transaction Amount : {$2500.00} * Dispute Outcome : * Amex stated that XXXX XXXX XXXX provided sufficient documentation to justify the charge. 
* According to the explanation, an extra charge was applied because the car was returned at XXXXXXXX XXXX instead of XXXXXXXX XXXX resulting in a higher total. 
* The merchant also claimed that a signed rental agreement reflected the total charge of {$2500.00}, including additional coverages. 

Why I Disagree 1. Agreed Price : The original confirmed price was {$1300.00}, including taxes. I did not authorize or approve any additional charges. 
2. Return Time Discrepancy : A 12-minute delay ( XXXXXXXX XXXX instead of XXXXXXXX XXXX  ) does not justify an overcharge of over {$1100.00}. 
3. Rental Agreement : I believe the merchant misrepresented the agreement to include unauthorized additional charges. I do not recall agreeing to any extra coverages or fees. They made it seem like the additional amount was a deposit that would be refunded to my account upon returning the vehicle. 

Rental Confirmation Details * Agency : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Location : XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, FL XXXX * Confirmation Number : XXXX * Pick-Up Date/Time : XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Drop-Off Date/Time : XX/XX/year>, at XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX Approximate Price : {$1300.00} ( including taxes ). 

Supporting Evidence * The original booking confirmation showing the agreed price of {$1300.00}. ( Attached )"
Mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue with the application process,"Originally began the process of taking assumption of my mortgage loan from my ex on XX/XX/year>. XXXX and forms requested were all sent over via email ( see attachments ) on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was able to speak with a mortgage consultant, XXXX XXXX. She reviewed all my paperwork, talked me through my options which involved a XXXX, a couple remaining items ( more recent pay stubs, see email attachments ), which were all sent over on XX/XX/XXXX. Since this time, I have been unable to receive confirmation that any of these documents were received, unable to speak with XXXX XXXX after many unanswered calls, voicemails left, and unanswered emails. The next step in this process was supposed to be underwriting ( which was originally communicated in XXXX as taking XXXX days once in underwriting ), so I tried to be patient. I eventually reached out to the generic NewRez phone line ( see list of phone communications below ) and no one could provide me with an answer, and it was recommended to send an email ( of which I have been doing and getting no response, see email attachments ). This has been completely unacceptable. My ex and I are both trying to move on from this situation and this has gone on long enough with no resolution, updates or explanations for the delay and lack of communication.

Student loan,Struggling to repay your loan,Problem with your payment plan,"I have multiple student loans serviced by DEPTEDXXXX, which have been on my credit report for over a decade. These loans have been in forbearance since I graduated in XXXX, as I have been unable to secure gainful employment that would allow me to repay them. Despite this, the loans continue to negatively impact my credit report, preventing me from obtaining stable housing and even some employment opportunities, as certain employers review credit reports. 

Here are the relevant details of the loans : - Opened between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 
XXXX  Total balances range from {$1900.00} to {$10000.00}. 
XXXX  Payments are listed as current, but the loans are still in forbearance due to my financial hardship. 

I have a child to support and have struggled to provide basic necessities, including housing, because these loans continue to limit my ability to qualify for assistance or improve my financial standing. I am requesting a review of whether these loans should remain on my credit report, as they have been in forbearance for over 11 years without progress, and are hindering my ability to achieve financial stability. 

Additionally, I have disputed these loans on my credit report in the past, but the disputes were resolved in favor of the servicer. I am seeking assistance to find a resolution, whether through removal of the loans from my report or other remedies to address this ongoing issue. 

Thank you for your help in addressing this matter."
Credit card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"Bank of America Claim ID : XXXX Multiple unauthorized purchases on my card. Called on XX/XX/XXXX after seeing over {$1400.00} of charges on my card i did not make. Account given temporary credit while they review. These charges were done around the location of XXXX of my home. A couple of the places like XXXX and XXXX  XXXX i have been to before. The other places I have not. Such as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  among others within that claim. When i initiated my claim I asked the rep to provide the expiration date of the card being used, as i had a card ( old card ) in my possession still. They told me they could not provide this information. All cards were cancelled at this time and replaced with a new card number. I received notification on XX/XX/XXXX that my claim was denied. I called up to inquire about the situation and had it escalated. I asked for the proof that they are basing their decision on and they said the chip was used and a signature was given. If the card was lost then the fact the chip was used does not prove anything and a signature is easily forged. They never sent me the proof requested either. I reopened the case and had it escalated as I did not make these transactions and BoA offers a {$0.00} Liability Guarantee covers fraudulent transactions made by others using your Bank of America consumer debit card. This falls under that category. Not sure if they are using AI to do their work now and since I do have a presence in XXXX XXXX XXXX that is causing the decision to be made. I reviewed my account on XX/XX/XXXX and found a notification they denied the claim again under the same reason. "" We confirmed your card was used for the charge ( s ). The chip was read, your PIN was entered, and/or you signed for the merchandise or service, which indicates you or someone you allowed to use your card was present. '' Their notation also said they reported to the credit agencies. Also, weve contacted these credit reporting agencies to add a comment to your credit report stating you disagree with our decision on your fraud claim. Please keep in mind it may take up to 60 days for the comment to appear on your credit file. Since I did not do these transactions, I don't understand how they can use this as a reason for denying my claim. I asked if they contacted the merchants for any video surveillance that would prove my claim to be true. They did not provide anything. They just keep repeating the generic answer of We confirmed your card was used for the charge ( s ). The chip was read, your PIN was entered, and/or you signed for the merchandise or service, which indicates you or someone you allowed to use your card was present. This must be a generic response as the Credit card does not even have a PIN. On this same call I was on hold for 45 minutes between them transferring me around from person to person. Then they hung up at the 1hr 4min mark. Did not call me back. Called again- on hold for 8 minutes and was disconnected again. Called again was told they can only reopen the case and escalate again. I cant talk to anyone in the actual fraud division. Will be filing a police report later today and sending it to BoA to add to my case. 


Still trying to resolve this 6 months later. They continue to say they have no actual proof I made these transactions. Only that i am guilty because i live close by. 0 % fraud liability seems like a blatant lie by this company since they are trying to force me to pay for things I did not do. Refuse to supply any evidence that it was me. surveillance or if the transaction was completed online then a public IP address that matches with my own. There is 0 proof provided even when i directly ask them. Just the same generic response that is read off to me. How does a bank operate in such a manner and not get in legal trouble for actions such as this. Filed a police report and sent them this, in which their response was they don't care about it and it doesn't matter. 


This is their answer We notified you on XX/XX/XXXX, we were unable to approve your claim as your card was used for the charges. The chip was read, Personal Identification Number ( PIN ) was entered, and/or they signed for the merchandise or service, which indicates you or someone you allowed to use your card was present Nowhere in this does it have proof I did anything. How are we letting a bank get away with this?"

The collection agency ( XXXX ) gave me 40 days to respond either by writing or calling to either XXXX or XXXX ( the creditor ). I immediately called each of them 3 times. 

Knowing that they can easily deny my respond, each time I called and left messages, I specifically asked them to write me an email that acknowledged my respond. 

Unfortunately, the life agents of both companies refused to send me an email or any formal letter that acknowledged my respond. 

So, the only way for customers to get written proof of their respond by certified receipts mail. That will be time consuming, laborious, and expensive. 
I feel that it was arranged that way in order to trap to vulnerable people. For example, senior citizens with diminishing mental capacity, mentally XXXX, and limited English speaker. 

Most vulnerable people will not spend extra postage for return receipt, let alone to line up for hours at the post office, just to get written proof of their responds.

Discover extended the offer to me, which I had not solicited. The denial was also influenced by a delayed response from XXXX concerning a missing telephone number on their fraud alert. Unfortunately, the long and short of it is that the personal loan was denied when it should not have been, and I was treated very poorly by Discover Personal Loans. 

The persistent denials from Discover and XXXX are distressing and unfair, given that the nature of these transactions is clearly fraudulent. The scammer 's deceit and subsequent threats of physical harm have already caused me immense emotional distress, and the financial impact is exacerbating my hardship. 

Despite my reasonable faith efforts to dispute the fraudulent charges with Discover and XXXX, both institutions have maintained their stance that these charges are legitimate and have refused to remove them from my account. This continued refusal has placed a considerable financial burden on me, with a negative balance of {$2400.00} still reflecting on my Discover card, and has destroyed my credit."

Apparently they did not cancel my account and generated a bill, which I had no knowledge of. I have never once received any kind of a bill or I would have contacted T mobile and questioned it. 
I called XXXX XXXX  customer service at least 6 times trying to resole the issue. I was told there is nothing they can do since it is in collections. I was also told that they can see I returned their equipment and did not use their services and that they would notate that. 
I was told to contact the collection agency and tell the collection agency to look at T mobile 's notation. I was also told to go to the store and i was told by the manager that he could do nothing to help me and that I should just pay the bill and be thankful I have good health and it is only my credit score frustrating me. 
I filed XXXX disputes with XXXX and they say the collection is valid. 
I feel it is not because I should not have to pay for services that I dd not use."

XXXX XXXX XXXX FTC Charges it Misled Students About Career Training, Credit Transfers XX/XX/201XXXX XXXX Tags : Consumer Protection Bureau of Consumer Protection Education Finance deceptive/misleading conduct XXXX  XXXX XXXX has agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission charges it misrepresented to students that they would get the training and credentials needed to switch careers or get a new job, and that the course credits they earned would transfer to other schools. In reality, many programs offered by the for-profit institution did not meet state requirements for desired careers, and the claims made about credit transfers were often not true. 

When schools promise students they can transfer course credits or get a better job after completing their programs, theyd better be able to back up those claims, said XXXX XXXX, Director, FTCs Bureau of Consumer Protection. XXXX XXXX didnt tell the truth when it made those promises to prospective students. 

According to the Commissions complaint, the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, doing business as XXXX XXXX, violated the FTC Act by deceptively marketing its online college degree and career-training programs. The FTC alleges some degrees and programs offered by XXXX XXXX failed to meet the basic educational requirements set by state licensing boards for careers or jobs such as real estate appraisers, home inspectors, elementary school educators, massage practitioners, and more. The FTC also alleges the institution claimed that its credits would transfer even though it lacked supporting data that other colleges and universities would accept their credits. 

Tuition at XXXX XXXX ranges from hundreds to several thousand dollars. XXXX XXXX does not accept student loans, and students are required to pay tuition in full or make monthly payments. However, it does accept military  benefits including XXXX  XXXX  payments, and has directed some of its advertising to military servicemembers and their families. 

The proposed stipulated court order prohibits XXXX XXXX from misrepresenting that : completing XXXX program will qualify students to obtain vocational licenses without any additional training or experience ; XXXX programs provide all the training and credentials required to switch careers or obtain a job in a new field ; there will be job security or steady employment for consumers completing its programs ; and that course credits are generally recognized by, and accepted, by other postsecondary institutions. 
The order also includes an {$11.00} XXXX judgment, which is suspended based on the institutions inability to pay. 

Students interested in pursuing a higher education should check out the FTCs updated guidance, Choosing a College : Questions to Ask. Commission staff also has a new post, An Unlikely Commencement Address, on the Business Center Blog. 

The Commission vote authorizing the filing of the complaint and the proposed stipulated court order was 5-0. The complaint and proposed order were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of XXXX  on XX/XX/2015. 

The Federal Trade Commission works for consumers to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair business practices and to provide information to help spot, stop, and avoid them.

Credit card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"I am writing to register a formal complaint against Citi Bank for the illegitimate closure of my recently opened CitiBank AAdvantage XXXX Credit Card. 

I applied for and was approved for this card at the end of XX/XX/2024. Since receiving the card, I have complied with all terms and conditions and have not received any prior warnings or notifications regarding my account being in jeopardy. Much to my surprise, today-XX/XX/2024-I found that Citi Bank has closed my account without giving any explanation or reason.

When I spoke with Citi Bank today and asked for an account manager, they could not explain why the account was closed. The manager explicitly expressed that the account closure "" does not make sense, '' again highlighting that there is no valid reason or clear communication for this decision. 

What makes this even more vexing is that, by the time the card was closed, I had already spent {$7000.00} on it, meeting its spending requirement for the sign-on bonus. This sudden closing seems to be a false and misleading business practice that could also be a CFPA violation under 12 U.S.C. 5531, since it prohibits any act or practice in connection with any consumer financial product or service that involves unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices ( UDAAPs ). 

This act has dislocated my business, disrupted my credit profile, and more importantly, has eroded trust in Citi Bank as a house. What is worse, however, is that without providing a clear explanation or even allowing me a hearing of my alleged concerns, a failure to apply the basic principles of fairness and accountability has occurred. 

I request the immediate reinstatement of my account. It is not only against basic notions of equity but also possibly in contravention of the responsibilities imposed on them by consumer protection laws. In case Citi Bank feels that this closure was justified, I hereby request a detailed reason, quoting correctly any violation or terms on which such an action was based. 

Furthermore, I am asking for : The immediate reopening of my account. 
A complete investigation into the unjustified account closure was in order. Assurance that this incident in no way affects my credit report or, indeed, any business operations. Immediate action to ensure the sign-on bonus I had qualified for. I view this situation as an unfair and deceptive practice that is contrived to deny me benefits under the credit card agreement. I request the CFPB 's assistance in investigating and resolving this matter promptly. 

Please feel free to contact me if further details are required at XXXX or XXXX.

Debt collection,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"I have written to formally dispute the charges on my XXXX XXXX lease ( Account Number : XXXX ) as well as the predatory practices and harassment I have endured since XX/XX/year>. 

During the COVID-19 lockdown, I made multiple attempts to return the vehicle in accordance with the lease agreement terms, but my return was refused due to dealership closures and restrictions related to the pandemic. Under the terms of my lease agreement, I was entitled to return the vehicle at **Normal Maturity Lease End** or **before** the lease end date. 
The refusal to accept the vehicle directly violated the agreement, which stipulates that I may return the vehicle either to the dealership that leased me the vehicle or to any other location that you designate. Despite my efforts, Ally Financial and its affiliates failed to honor this contractual obligation. As a result of your refusal to accept the vehicle, I have been subjected to unjust and predatory charges, including excess mileage and wear fees that would have been waived had the return process been followed as outlined in the agreement. 
These charges were imposed despite my good faith efforts to comply with the lease terms and the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic. 
Additionally, XXXX consumer protection laws, which were enforced during the pandemic, specifically protected consumers from predatory practices, including refusal to accept lease returns. 
Your refusal to accept my lease return during this time violates these protections and constitutes a breach of contract. 
In addition, I was also deprived of a fair opportunity to settle my lease under the best financial terms. 
This refusal resulted in unnecessary excess fees and charges, making them predatory in nature. The contract outlines that excess mileage and wear fees are capped by the vehicle 's residual value. But since I was unable to return the vehicle, these charges have been wrongfully imposed. 

I request that you immediately : 1. Remove all charges related to the excess mileage, wear, and other penalties.

2. Correct the derogatory information on my credit report and provide me with a deletion letter.

3. Confirm in writing that this issue has been resolved and the charges removed.

Please respond to this dispute within 30 days, as required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

I expect a resolution to this matter promptly and will escalate to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX if necessary.

Credit card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Problem with customer service,"Complaint Regarding Venmo Credit Card Account : App Bug, Miscommunication, and Customer Support Failures Dear PayPal Customer Service Team, I am writing to formally raise a complaint regarding Venmo and its handling of my Venmo Credit Card account. This issue has caused significant financial and emotional distress and has not been addressed adequately. While XXXX XXXX  the financier of the Venmo Credit Card, has responded to my previous complaint, it is clear that the responsibility for the problems I encountered lies with Venmo/PayPal. 

Background of the Issue On XX/XX/year>, I received an alert from my credit monitoring service about a drastic drop in my credit score, suggesting potential identity theft. I immediately investigated all my accounts and discovered an unexpected balance of {$9900.00} on my Venmo Credit Card, along with approximately {$2600.00} in interest charges.

As a loyal Venmo user, I have relied heavily on the Venmo app to manage my account. However, despite checking the app frequently, I never saw this balance or any alerts about the accrued interest. The apps display consistently showed Venmo Credit Card without any clear balance or payment information, misleading me into thinking my account was in good standing. 

Additionally, I received paper statements from Venmo every month, and none of them showed this balance or the accumulating interest. This failure of communication from Venmoboth through the app and via mailed statementsprevented me from addressing the issue in a timely manner. 

XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  has confirmed that their billing processes are compliant and that all statements were sent according to their records. While I acknowledge their explanation, my complaint is not about XXXX or its processesit is about Venmos app functionality, its failure to display accurate account information, and the failure of its customer support team to resolve the issue.

Key Points of My Complaint Venmo App Bug and Miscommunication : The Venmo app failed to display my balance or provide adequate notifications about my account status. This is a technical failure that misled me into believing there were no outstanding balances or interest charges. Screenshots of the apps misleading interface are available to demonstrate this issue. 
Failure of Customer Support : When I discovered the issue, I contacted Venmo customer support and spent over an hour speaking with multiple representatives. Despite raising valid concerns about the apps functionality and lack of communication, I was met with dismissive responses and no actionable resolution.

Unacceptable Shift of Responsibility to XXXX XXXX  Venmo has effectively deflected responsibility to XXXX Bank, yet this issue clearly stems from Venmos platform, which users like me rely on to monitor and manage accounts. XXXX can not be held accountable for Venmos app bugs or customer service failures."

I was out of state XXXX through the month of XXXX XX/XX/2024 after receiving my mail I found the Insurance ckeck and XXXX XXXX  statement I called and spoke to XXXX to inquire as to why my monthly payment went up XXXX.

XXXX XXXX, I called XXXX to ck progress. I spoke to XXXX. She told me there was no progress and that XXXX could not void a XXXX XXXX ck and to go ahead and cash it.

XXXX there is an unapplied payment for XXXX, a payment of XXXX, a negative payment of XXXX, and another negative payment of XXXX. What is that all about? The only payment I made was for XXXX.

XXXX another late fee for XXXX.

However, the documents that Midland requires states the exact repairs, amounts and draw schedule.

I again advised that we need the full amount. I also relayed the additional damage being caused to the home, which caused Midland to give a counteroffer of {$25000.00}.

No one has been able to give clear, correct information about what is going on and why our funds are being held unnecessarily. 

We have submitted every piece of information that is required. Somewhere, there is a disconnect and the documentation is not being clearly read.

Despite my efforts to explain this honest misunderstanding, Synchrony has refused to provide any assistance, saying that the information was in the statements. While I admit I missed those notifications amidst a flood of emails from Synchrony 6-8 a month, I have always maintained my accounts with Synchrony, dating back to XXXX, and have never had a late payment, ever. 

Given my perfect history with Synchrony, I believe the added {$7400.00} interest fee is an excessive penalty for a minor oversight of missing the promotional deadlines by just three months. I am prepared to pay the balance in full immediately and am simply requesting the removal of the added interest, as this fee is exorbitant and could significantly harm my familys finances."

Despite this, I.Q. Data International has not updated the account balance or provided a response addressing the court order. Instead, I received a second letter dated XX/XX/2024 ( Reference : XXXX ), which still lists the incorrect total of {$2600.00}, including an additional {$40.00} in interest."

On XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX charge was "" returned ''. I do not know why but given that this was the first payment, a likely cause is a mistyped account number. Capital One refuses to provide the information needed to verify this hypothesis though they clearly have it because otherwise they could not initiate an ACH transfer. Their refusal also makes it impossible to show that they are at fault. The ACH charge does not show on the XXXX side. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I learned of the problem because CapitalOne restricted ( i.e. suspended ) XXXX. Not knowing what the problem was, I did an ACH transfer of {$14000.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). This transfer was successful. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I did an XXXX transfer of {$540.00} from the original account, XXXX, to pay the not-yet-due balance. This transfer was successful. 

Capital One then suspended another, unrelated, credit card, XXXX. This card has a scheduled autopay from XXXX and has been current on payments since its inception ( at least one year, Capital One 's web site does not let me go further back ) Given the likely cause of this situation and the fact that Capital One and that I've given Capitol One all the money that they are due, and did so within hours of learning of the situation, it's unreasonable that Capital One continues to accuse me of fraud. 

They've demanded a ridiculous amount of information from me. Among other things, Capital One demanded a utility bill for "" proof of residence ''. The utility company quite rightly refused to verify my billing address when Capital One called. So, their fraud department wanted something else. I pointed out that the bank statement that Capital One demanded had my address on it ( it's the original XXXX account ) they told me to resubmit the same sheet of paper that I'd already given them again but this time mark it "" proof of residence '', not "" bank statement ''. This is ridiculous. 

At this point, I'm thinking that Capital One is merely trying to avoid paying out the "" rewards '' on XXXX. Why they also want to kill what had been a satisfactory business relationship by restricting XXXX, I just can't fathom."

Credit card,Trouble using your card,Can't use card to make purchases,
Credit card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"Hello, I have different balances on my Citi XXXX XXXX  credit card ( different % XXXX, promo periods, loans, etc ). 

I used to have : - BalTrnOffer 5 : 0.99 % expiring XX/XX/XXXX. 

I waited until the next statement after XX/XX/XXXX to confirm "" BalTrnOffer 5 '' no longer showed 0.99 %, but a high 24.24 %. I called to verify the correct payoff amount, then I paid {$15000.00} online on XX/XX/XXXX. This successfully paid off BalTrnOffer 5. 

The phone rep explained that I had accrued a little bit of interest by waiting to make a payment until *after* the statement. He said ( paraphrased ), "" Next time, you can pay *on the day* the promo rate expires. You don't have to wait for the statement. 

That was great advice! The next balance to pay off was : - BalTrnOffer 7 : 0 % expiring XX/XX/XXXX Just to be extra safe, I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and/or XX/XX/XXXX. And again, the phone rep told me, "" Yes, you can pay now because the promo period has ended -- and your payment will pay off this BalTrnOffer 7 balance. '' Perfect! I paid {$8500.00}. ( I believe I made the payment on the phone with the rep. ) But instead of paying down BalTrnOffer 7, my payment was assigned to : - Plan 4 : 60-month loan@ 8.99 % This messed up my entire pay-off plan because I was diligently monitoring and paying down my highest-interest balances first, wanting to leave my low-interest loan to be paid off at the end of its term. ( Plus, my loan was set for 60 months@ 8.99 % -- there was no need to pay this off early while BalTrnOffer 7 went up to 24.24 %! ) I talked to Citi multiple times ( at least half a dozen ) and each time was told they were investigating this matter to correct it. 

I specifically asked them to listen to the phone call on XX/XX/XXXX where I was told that my payment would pay off BalTrnOffer 7. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I was told this recording had been listened to on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, a phone rep said my request was resolved and I would see my corrected balances soon. I was also assured that the interest that had been accruing due to the mis-assigning of my payment would be credited to me. 

But all I have been receiving are generic letters from Citi explaining that payments go to balance in APR order from lowest to highest. ( I knew that -- that's why I was so careful to ensure my BalTrnOffer 7 was indeed high interest at the time of my payment. ) Sorry, this has been very frustrating. I believe I have a strong case because multiple Citi representatives repeatedly told me that my payment would pay off BalTrnOffer 7, specifically calls on : - XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX and - XX/XX/XXXX ( when I paid off XXXX XXXX ) Thank you very much for your help."

Credit card,Getting a credit card,Application denied,"Received mailer for Bank of America Customized Cash Card and applied by phone on XX/XX/XXXX. Was informed that I was approved for just over $ XXXX credit limit and I would be receiving my card in 5-7 business days. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my neighbor received a call on her phone from someone from BoA fraud department asking for me. The phone number they called was NOT LISTED ON MY APPLICATION NOR WAS IT ASSOCIATED WITH ME IN ANY WAY IN ANY PUBLIC RECORD. 

She, suspecting it was a fraudster, told the caller to not call again and hung up. 

She told me about it later that evening, after which I called BoA and spent over 2 hours on the phone trying to escalate my complaint, as this was extremely concerning to me and I had no way of knowing how they came to the idea to call the number they did and how many other numbers they called.

Was told that they would share no information about the situation with me, but that I could continue with the process of the application and verify other ways later if I wanted. I decided to wait and think about it and follow-up the next day with the Case Number they gave me. 

I called the next day, XX/XX/XXXX, to try to get more info on the progress of my complaint. They said I would have to verify. They "" could not '' find me in their system with MY PHONE NUMBER, but I explained the situation, to which they requested the number they had incorrectly called. Suddenly, they could then miraculously find my account! Was told the application was denied, which I feel was merely retaliation. 

Was advised to visit a branch in-person to verify physically and have a customer profile entered directly from there. I did so. Was again on the phone while at the branch trying to get this fixed. Several agents said they understood my concerns and agreed that this was not right. Phone agent said they had successfully verified me and reopened the application. At the phone agent 's advise, the bank manager created my profile directly using my accurate and real ID info ( same info as provided on the application ), he placed a note in the system to not change any account contact data without me being physically present in a branch, and told me to wait a couple of days for the profile to go through normal upload procedures and propagate into the banks larger database. I did so. 

I called today, XX/XX/XXXX, only to be bounced around for another 2 hours ( at this point, I've spent approximately 7+ hours on the phone with BoA ), getting transferred and being told I was sent to the wrong department over and over again. Finally got on to look up my case number, only to find out it had been set to resolved and closed by "" apologizing to the client '' I do not feel an apology satisfactorily resolves my issue. They used incorrect info from an unknown source. They attempted to discuss MY application with a person by voice alone should be able to tell was NOT me ( I am male and from the XXXX, neighbor is female and from XXXX - and remember, I applied by phone call which had recorded segments, that they obviously did not refer to before calling ). They revealed my name and that I had applied for a Bank of America card to an individual they had NOT verified, which is valuable information to a potential ID thief or fraudster. They would not provide any info as to HOW MANY OTHER PHONE CALLS THEY MADE TO UNKNOWNS. 

Bank of America should be strongly reprimanded for terrible fraud prevention procedures ( calling phone numbers not connected with the applicant ), for breach of trust and publishing private info ( for telling an unverified individual they were calling from BoA for me by name about a card application ) That is too much info to be giving out. Customers should be informed of ALL PHONE NUMBERS/EMAILS/ETC. that are NOT ON THE APPLICATION BoA uses to contact applicants. BoA should inform applicants that they will call numbers not on the application ( still don't know why they wouldn't at least try to contact me by my phone number, which the repeatedly refused to ) I could see if in this situation, BoA should, if they are too lazy to use contact info that appears in application which matches my profiles at other banks and on my credit reports as well as XXXX and XXXX reports, then they should have ONLY sent a letter to my address, which is clearly OWNED BY ME as evidenced by county public tax records and deed records. BoA should change their procedures to protect applicants and their existing customers. Their actions are beyond understanding. BTW, as a XXXX, I'd never give a passing opinion on their actions in an audit!"

So I called Nordstrom customer service and the representative says it looks like you called and made a payment, and I said, No I did not..that is not true.

The representative stated a caller with a XXXX phone number used the automated systemI literally said that makes no sense. I have never used an automated system or would need anyone to call in on my behalf to use my personal banking information to pay my account. The representative then told me she could put pin pass word on my account and reissue me a new card..so I established a pin password, which I still dont understand why. Then the representative directed me to further dispute getting my funds back by contacting my bank directly. Thats it. I later did a quick web search for illegal Nordstrom credit card payments and there is a thread on the website XXXX with about XXXX people experiencing what I m going through with Nordstrom, XXXX people even commented after me stating they were dealing with the same issue and Nordstrom gave them the same exact response.

When you make the purchase you put in all of your information for payment to the same company that you were getting the installment from... Essentially making the first installments payment that day. For good reason I assumed that this would be used for all of my future payments. I didn't opt out of paper billing. I didn't select anything special. 

3 months later I checked my credit report and it showed up as having unpaid accounts. Using that information I was able to track down a website to check on auto billing status. The company claims that no information was entered even though I clearly put all of it in when I made the first purchase or they wouldn't have sent me the computer I purchased. 

They sent me no bills or past due notices. I didn't even have any information to know who the financing was through... When I called the number after finding this website it claimed the financing was through Goldman Sachs, not Apple. They informed me that they never sent any paper bills... Even though there were past due notices on the account, I had no idea this was happening and that my initial payment information wasn't being used. 

I would understand if it was a third party financing company that I had set up a totally separate account with... But then you get all of your account information in the mail. The website I'm still being sent to is an Apple based website. Apple is the company that I entered all my payment information to initially. This seems like it is clearly set up as a scam for customers that would give us no way to understand that the information we are submitting upon agreeing to the payment plan requires additional setup beyond entering all of our payment information to make the first installment payment and get the item. This process needs to be fixed. It's predatory. They claimed to have sent emails, but unless it was just going to my spam box and being filtered out automatically, I certainly don't see them. And having no system to send paper bills if you aren't getting payments or not giving someone the option to opt in or out of online payments at the time they sign up so they are aware and have copies of all of their account information and website for setup for additional payments."

Per 12 CFR 1006.34 ( c ) ( 4 ) ( i ), your failure to provide accurate and complete disclosure of all necessary information prior to furnishing details to consumer reporting agencies further substantiates the illegal practices you are engaged in.

Vehicle loan or lease,Struggling to pay your loan,Denied request to lower payments,"In XX/XX/year>XXXX my active-duty husband was sent to California for a 6- to 7-month training course. At the time, I was unemployed, and all of our money went into relocating from Oregon to California. I contacted Western Funding in XX/XX/year> to request a payment extension to avoid losing my car, which is essential for my daily life. Instead of extending the payment, the representative said they would change my payment due date. I did not request this specific change, but they proceeded with it anyway. 

A few months later, I called again to request that my due date be moved to the 15th of the month since my husband, being in the military, is paid on the 1st and the 15th. Our rent is covered by the 1st paycheck, and bills are handled with the 15th paycheck. However, I was informed that my account had already reached the limit of two due date changes, even though I had only requested one changethe other was done without my consent. 

For the past year, I have repeatedly asked Western Funding to adjust my due date to the 15th to avoid late fees, but they have refused. As a result, Ive accrued {$58.00} in late fees despite consistently paying my car payment between the 11th and 15th, depending on when my paycheck clears. I am a reliable customer who makes payments every month, yet their refusal to adjust my due date feels unethical, as it seems they prefer to collect additional money through late fees. 

Additionally, there is an error in how they are reporting to the credit bureaus. My credit report reflects an extra {$16.00} added to my balance, even though I am making my payments each month. 

Ive also attempted to speak with a supervisor multiple times, but I am consistently told that no one is available. This has made resolving the issue even more difficult. I believe these practices are unfair and would appreciate having my concerns addressed."

I am seeing if my family members were up to this as they have all of my information at hand. I really don't need these loans on my credit due to me trying to get a house. They aren't even mine to begin with as I had no knowledge about them whatsoever.

Debt collection,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I entered an agreement with XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( services obtained from XXXX XXXX XXXX ) located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  contact number XXXX for a shower remodel at my residence for the price of {$12000.00}. The agreement was a pre printed yellow form of a contract. Prior to the execution of the contract, XXXX XXXX asked me for my social security number to ensure financing for the project. They failed to explain to me the cancellation policy or the financing rules and regulations, it was only confirmed that the loan application ( XXXX XXXXXXXX ) was approved by Momnt located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. I went through the next few months after signing the agreement without any communication from XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX. I reached out to XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX every week multiple times inquiring when will the installation of my shower be installed and I kept receiving the runaround ( responses such as the vendor lost the materials so we have to start the order all over again ) during each call that I made. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX never contacted me ( via email or phone ) and eventually, they stopped answering my calls and I left numerous voicemail messages on both numbers listed above asking for a returned phone call. 

I contacted Momnt, around XX/XX/XXXX informing them that XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX has stopped communicating with me therefore leaving me without a remodeled shower installation & I was told by Momnt that they will have to conduct an investigation. According to the FCRA it is the company responsibility to follow up regarding this contract as a consumer. Both XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Momnt violated me as the consumer, 15 U.A. code 1681ab permissible purposes of consumer reports. No one sent me documentation regarding the loan and no services were rendered-12 CFR Part 1022 ( Fair Credit Reporting ) along with 16 CFR 433 A and B ( Preservation of consumers ' claims and defenses, unfair or deceptive acts or practices. ) I repeatedly asked numerous times of copies of documentation with my wet ink signature at which XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX nor Momnt failed to provide me. As a consumer ( myself ) these documents were supposed to have been provided. 

Momnt sent me an email recently as of XX/XX/XXXX stating that "" we placed a provisional credit on your account while we investigated an issue related to your account and/or your merchant.Our review is complete, and we have determined that the provisional credit should be removed from your account and the loan should be placed in active status in 30 days. '' However, when I called XXXX that same day to inquire about the investigation they had conducted since XXXX, I was told that they can not disclose the information to me. I requested for the loan to be removed from my name, financial and credit records-15 U.S. code 6802 Nonpublic personal information Obligations with respect to disclosure of personal information. Neither company can provide documentation that i am soley responsible for services that i did not receive. My request made was disregarded as then I asked to speak to a manager and was told that they don't have any managers to speak with about this matter. I was told that I'm stuck with the loan and that, I need to start making payments as soon as possible. 

As of today, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX have not reponded to any of my complaints. I have been harassed by Momnt via emails every month reminding me of payments that needed to be made prior them completing their so called investigation. I am devastated that I've been waiting over a year for a brand new shower that was never installed. The mental anguish of going through this process had been overwhelming, stressful and uncomprehensible. Under the circumstances, this loan should have already been removed from my financial and credit records several months ago and their lack of responsiveness, unprofessionalism and accountability have violated several standards. We will discuss credit report violations, compensation and removing this from my credit report. Please assist in taking action with whatever means that are available. 

Much Regards, XXXX XXXX"

Student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Keep getting calls about your loan,"Log in Sign up You said : please rewrite this note, for clarity, thank you. This complaint is concerning XXXX  and Mohela 's loan services for my student loans. The continuous frequent phone calls have caused me to feel traumatized as a senior.

I am making this complaint that is pertain to the constant calls I receive daily even though I have made a forbearing agreement with them. I have spoken to representatives from XXXX  and Mohela to please stop calling me. However, that was ignored, and the calls continues even though my account has been transferred to Mohela. Despite my account being approved for bearing status, I received an email requesting payment. I have made it very clear to contact me by mail or by regular mail and not by phone, but that request is not being followed.

Whenever I talk to them, I am subjected to harassment and pressure to make payments. Additionally, they do not examine the account to check if I had previously communicated with them to check my account 's status. It seems that their only objective is to persist with phone calls and disregard the status of the account. I have also made several attempt to go to the website and I was denied accesses.

They have been told about my situation, which includes not working and not receiving any Social Security benefits. After asking for a forbearance and sending a money order to process it for three months, my request was approved. The representative took note of my account and requested that I call back in 3 months if I am unable to work to ask for another forbearing. I ask to send me a copy by mail, but I never received it. Whenever a representative calls, they seem to lack knowledge about the status of my account and that it is currently in a forbearing state. I have no idea how to deal with the continuous phone calls. I've asked for them to review my account and discontinue the number of representatives calling me, which starts early in the XXXX  before XXXXXXXX XXXX but it continues and I'm uncertain what to do. 
After my XXXX XXXX church service, XXXX and XXXX I was contacted by XXXX of XXXX  via voicemail at XXXX. Which said I need to contact a counselor to make payment arrangements. I have submitted my number to the do not call. Gov website list today with the hope this call persistent will stop. However, they have disregarded my request and continuously calling. Please advise what is the best way for me to approach this issue, thank you.

Subject : Complaint Regarding Unwanted and Harassing Calls from XXXX  and Mohela and disregarding the forbearance agreement To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding the ongoing harassment and unwanted phone calls I have been receiving from XXXX  and Mohela concerning my student loans. As a senior, these frequent calls have caused me significant distress, and despite my repeated requests to stop, they continue. I received a letter in XXXX that my loans would be services by Mohela and yet XXXX  continuously calling me as well as Mohela. I have told them both to stop calling, but it persist.

I have already made a forbearance agreement with XXXX, and my account is currently in forbearance status. In XXXX, it has to be renewed by me sending XXXX XXXX dollars to re establish the forbearance. However, I continue to receive daily phone calls, even though my account has been transferred to Mohela. Despite informing their representatives that I only wish to be contacted by mail, my requests have been ignored, and the calls persist.

Additionally, I received an email from them requesting a payment, which is confusing since my forbearance status has been approved. When I speak to representatives, I am often subjected to pressure and harassment to make payments, even though they fail to check the status of my account or acknowledge my previous communications. It seems that their only focus is making phone calls, regardless of the current status of my account.

I have also tried to access my account online through the website but have been denied access multiple times. Ive communicated my financial situation, including not working and not receiving Social Security benefits. After submitting a money order for a forbearance request, I was told to call back in three months if I am still unable to work. However, I never received a written confirmation of this agreement, even though I specifically requested it.

Despite my account being in forbearance, I continue to receive calls from XXXX  and Mohela representatives who appear to have no knowledge of the forbearance status. The calls start as early as XXXX a.m., and I am unable to stop them. On Sunday mornings, XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year>, I received voicemails from XXXX at XXXX  ( phone number XXXX ), stating that I need to contact a counselor to make payment arrangements. 

I have already registered my number with the DoNotCall.gov website, but the calls have not stopped. I am at a loss for how to handle this ongoing situation and am seeking your advice on the best course of action. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response."

Summary : The VA allows lenders 45 days to process loans. I am now on day XXXX. We signed a contract in late XXXX. The assumption pkg was delivered on or about XX/XX/XXXX. Since then, I've been asked for some documents multiple times after having sent them each time. Only a week or so ago was an Escalation Manager was assigned. After multiple attempts to find a way to reach this person other than the department email address, I did receive a call. I told her that months ago I was told one had been assigned. She could find no record of that. She also could not find the documents I sent a week prior scanned into their system. I sent them again. Those were the same documents requested and provided four times prior. During this process, starting approximately 2 weeks into it, I would ask to speak to someone assigned to the assumption so that we could communicate more frequently. Even though I made that request multiple times, nobody in the Assumption Department would even acknowledge they received that request. ( For that matter, I've left three voicemails just this week for that Escalation Manager with no response. ) Most often, after delivering the documents I would just get an email ( a week later ) saying the documents have been sent to the VA for their underwriters to review. The VA doesn't have underwriters ... they are internal to PHH. I even called them out on that ( having been a VA and FHA underwriter many years ago, and it didn't change their answer ). Again and again they would wait several days after I send, or resend, the requested documents before telling me, again, that they have been sent to VA 's 'government underwriters '. As example : A couple of weeks after responding to a request, I asked via email if there were any further questions from the underwriter and they said they are still waiting on me to send the requested documents ( the same one 's I had provided multiple times ). That, across multiple occasions, has added a month to the process. The initial assumption packet asked for a Credit Report fee of {$19.00}. Two weeks after sending that check I was told they hadn't received the checks. I provided a tracking number documenting receipt by PHH. They then informed me that {$19.00} isn't the correct amount anyway. The didn't seem too concerned that their initial welcome packet was incorrectly stating required upfront fees. That next day I overnighted the new undocumented amount. To this day that check has not cleared my bank. The original check was returned a month after it was received by someone at PHH with a note there wasn't sufficient information to know what it was for. Even thought I had the property address in the note. The last request for additional documents was the XXXX of XXXX. It is now the XXXX and no reply has been received from PHH. As a 100 % XXXX veteran, this has been probably more stressful than it should be. I feel lost and forgotten. Nobody at PHH seems to care. If they do, they haven't bothered to say anything to me. The sellers ( note holders ) signed an authorization document allowing PHH to speak to me about the loan process early in this endeavor. So that's not a valid reason, if given. I've lost three buyers for my home during this time. I've afraid to list it again until this is finally resolved. Which, of course means that I'll have two mortgage payments until mine sells and closes. VA XXXX and Social Security retirement dollars are not near enough to sustain that for long."

They are currently contacting me via XXXX XXXX firm, and It was brought to my attention that XXXX being sued for missed payments with interest included, totaling {$XXXX}. I have tried on numerous occasions to get a settlement before court and I am getting nothing but the run around. They are not being very helpful or understanding of my situation. I received the loan amount of {$XXXX} on XX/XX/XXXX, and my first automatic withdrawal for the amount of {$XXXX} was successful. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was let go from my job, and my check was held for administrative purposes. With the interest rate at XXXX  %, and was struggling to make timely payments. I reached out to XXXX loan to explain my situation and to see if we could work something out for the remaining balance. By XXXX of XXXX, I was XXXX  months behind on rent, and car payments and was struggling to stay on top of my utility payments. At this time I was facing extreme financial hardship and thought I was doing the right thing by explaining my situation. Also during this time I was taking care of my grandparents who both suffered from XXXX  XXXX. Currently my grandmother needs full supportive and personal cares now with her battle with XXXX XXXX and my grandfather has XXXX  XXXX or XXXX  times a week and has trouble doing things around the house. As the burden has swiftly switched to my responsibility, even with a new job, XXXX often using our last to take care of the household. I called American cash loans the after being served court papers, explaining my situation and they told my they cant do anything for me but provide my pay off amount. When I ask to settle I was referred to this number ( XXXX ) XXXX. I then gave them a call, and the representative stated that he cant help at this point because the account has been referred to XXXX. He then provided me with XXXX numbers : ( XXXX ) XXXX and ( XXXX ) XXXX. Ive since left voicemails, and sent a email to XXXX. I received a response from XXXX asking for all my financial info so they can garnish my checks. Before the court date roughly around XXXX, XXXX ( court date XX/XX/XXXX ) I contacted XXXX to get on a payment plan which they agreed to me paying {$XXXX} I believe the XXXX of each month until same time next year, which would equal to me paying {$XXXX} in total! I feel like this is very unreasonable, and complete usury considering that the interest rate is predatory and I have tried to get ahead of this by explaining my situation multiple times to XXXX loans. Even with explaining my situation to XXXX, they totally disregarded what I said I can afford and could settle for during this time of extreme hardship for my family. 

Out of the {$XXXX} loan I owe {$XXXX} without the interest. I offered to settle the debt with {$XXXX} cash before it got to court. XXXX even on a payment plan with XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX and have paid at least {$XXXX} back on the loan. I can no longer afford this and this is complete usury. My purpose for writing is in hopes that I can settle this debt and move forward and continue providing for my grandparents, and preparing for what XXXX come from their illnesses. I have no support system and im learning new things everyday. I truthfully regret taking a loan with this interest rate, but look to this experience as a learning experience. I have dreams and aspirations as most Americans do, to be debt free, and to XXXX day own a home. Please help me with my issue with this loan company."

A few days later I received an email stating the attachments did not go through, so I sent once again and once again asking for a call. A few days later I received the same email again so this time I printed everything out, scanned all the documents and reset. 

A few days later I received an email from XXXX XXXX  indicating they were issuing a full refund for {$9900.00} ( what I paid ) so I assumed the dispute was settled as I sent all documentation supporting the XXXX  day guarantee, proof of my loss, and conversations with XXXX XXXX. 

Yesterday I called Citi to confirm and was told that my dispute was closed as time elapsed. I asked why I was told I had XXXX  days and that the delays were on XXXX  side.

I believe this action constitutes a violation of the terms outlined in my original retail installment contract ( see attached document ( XXXX ) and an amended contract that I submitted on XX/XX/XXXX. 

According to my original retail installment contract, any amendments must be documented in writing and signed by both parties. I submitted an amended retail installment contract, which was sent via USPS Registered Mail, acknowledged as received on XX/XX/XXXX ( tracking number XXXX ) to Hyundais Motor Finance Trustee XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX ( tracking number XXXX ) at XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( See attached document ( s ) who are the sole trustees based on Hyundai Auto Receivables XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, SEC XXXX annual report which is filed with Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) XXXX This document is a legitimate and binding amendment to the original agreement, establishing my rights as the buyer. 

Hyundai Motor Finance has failed to honor the amended contract, disregarding the changes made, which ultimately led to the wrongful repossession of my vehicle. This failure represents a breach of contract that violates regulations in the UCC and the Truth in Lending Act of 1933. Additionally, I have not received my security interests or necessary documentation to conduct business in good faith, further illustrating a breach of trust that could be perceived as security fraud. 

Furthermore, I have expressly revoked any rights granted to Hyundai Motor Finance to repossess my vehicle and have not consented to share my personal information with any third party. This unauthorized repossession raises significant concerns regarding potential identity theft and fraud, under the regulations outlined in 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a promissory note in the amount of {$54000.00}, which represented the total full pay amount due on the vehicle. The instructions provided with this promissory note ( see attached document ( s ) specified that Hyundai had ten days to respond to any issues regarding the note ; however, my attempts to communicate and resolve this matter have been ignored. 

Thank you for your attention to this serious matter. I look forward to your prompt response."

Despite never entering into a contract with World Acceptance Corporation, I find that you are reporting I owe a debt to your company. Notably, World Finance is also reporting this same debt, yet neither company operates as a legitimate debt collector according to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ).

I recently spoke with a representative from World Finance, who asserted that your company is a separate entity. During this conversation, the representative was unable to explain why an account charged off at {$180.00} has inexplicably accumulated to an amount well beyond this initial figure. It wasnt until a senior representative made a call to the home office that he received undocumented information regarding the reasons for the interest applied over time, which has resulted in a total that exceeds the maximum allowable limit. This lack of transparency and documentation raises serious concerns about the validity of the claimed debt. 

The representative then offered me an option to settle the alleged debt at a sum that exceeds the original charged-off amount, further highlighting inconsistencies and raising questions about the legitimacy of this claim and the methods employed to recoup this alleged debt. 

I believe this situation constitutes a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), as you are reporting inaccurate information to credit bureaus without the appropriate contractual agreements or documentation to substantiate the debt in question. 

I request that you promptly investigate this matter, correct any inaccuracies in your reporting, and cease communications regarding this alleged debt until this issue has been resolved. Please provide a written response detailing the steps you will take to rectify this situation.

Just like many other people in this world, XXXX  and XXXX were extremely difficult for our family. For many years prior to XXXX XXXX he worked hard and was away a lot, `but we were able to live a good life.  We had the things we needed and made sure we helped the three boys as well.

When XXXX went out on XXXX, he had no idea there were several different problems he was having. It was difficult to see the specialist doctors because many decreased their hours due to XXXX. So, between not being able to get in to see the doctor and the additional unexpected medical problems the months flew by quickly. He was still able to bring in close to the amount of money he made when he was working. (I have a letter that I sent in several weeks ago, but I could never confirm you received it.

I realize working with customers is difficult because I did it for over XXXX  years. There are so many things that end up getting mixed up or dropped and before you know it you have an angry customer. 

What I would like to let you know is when I was able to get someone on the phone, they were very kind and understanding which helped me a lot. The problem was getting them on the phone and the changes weekly in what they requested. 

Because XXXX was not cleared by the XXXX to fly, he decided to take a job in Texas to try to catch up on our bills. XXXX did the application and mailed it in sometime the end of XXXX When he started his job in Texas on XXXX XXXX XXXX, he had all the information with him. For several months paperwork was requested and sent in, but I could never get anyone to respond that they received it. We were never told a contact person so that was a huge problem.

I tried numerous times to find out exactly what I needed to send but they would mail me the same loss ligation form each time. I had information I wanted to explain to someone, but it was difficult to get someone on the phone. I often waited for XXXX minutes before leaving a message or hanging up. I remember recently, I spoke to two people and one of them was trying to get a manager, and I ended up being on the phone holding for an XXXX  and XXXX  minutes. I was told someone would call me back, but by the time I received the message the office was closed.

Having people that can answer the phone in a timely manner is critical. I believe if you are trying to reach customer service it is okay, but the loss litigation number is always a nightmare.  I have stay on the phone every time at least XXXX  minutes and usually more like XXXX  minutes or an hour.  I would not have waited so long but no one would answer an email. That is a huge problem. If the staff emailed it would save time and they would be able to get more done without so many interruptions. 

The phone would give you an option occasionally to press 1 and leave a message, but I never had anyone call me back. I cannot begin to tell you the frustration and stress when you need to get someone, and they do not email or call you back.

It was my understanding from talking to several of the employees that everything would be okay I just needed to provide the information, but it was like a never-ending circle. One week something was requested and then the next week something else which in many causes had already been sent in. I have never in my entire life had to deal with such and unorganized company.

Finally, the end of XXXX we received a letter to contact someone by the name of XXXX XXXX The letter requested I work with XXXX which sounded great, but I could not reach him. I tried for about a week and so did XXXX. I finally found out his extension XXXX  did not work because he was working from home. That was when I almost lost it. 

All I want at this point is for someone to talk to XXXX and explain exactly what you need. Due to my XXXX, I said I would have to stay out of it, but that did not happen because of XXXX schedule so I ended up helping and ended up being put on XXXX  medication.  

Because you have the calls recorded you should be able to go back and listen to the calls that were made, and I can send you a list of the emails if you would like them. My only concern is XXXX is in class almost every day so I do not know if you will be able to reach him. His number is XXXX and mine is XXXX

I have been more than willing the entire time to provide you with anything you want, but communication is the problem. We need emails or calls to let us what is needed as well as notify us if you received it.

I hope you will be willing to work with us and that this can be resolved without any additional delays or complications.

Sincerely,

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX

Loan# [protected]: my home loan modification and partial claim experience
Approx. two years ago I went into hardship due to XXXX death. My account was turned over to Dovenmuehle and my nightmare began. I was placed in forbearance and each time this company sent me my paperwork, it was the wrong paperwork. When I would call them, they would say they didn't receive the paperwork, or they would say I didn't fill out the correct...

Wrongful Foreclosure pending
I reached out in XXXX XXXX to state my husband and I were experiencing financial hardship because of XXXX and I filed a loss mitigation application that same month. I have provided all documentation requested and they always tell me I'm missing the items that I have already submitted. This has now been going on XXXX  months and they still keep telling me I am missing something.

My house is set for foreclosure and I have exhausted all options. I even applied for help through the state I live in and they cannot process my application until Dovemuehle processes my loss mitigation application, which at this point they are purposely not helping me. I thought they wanted to work with borrowers to find a solution, but I do not feel like they want to help me at all. I have two little girls that they would rather leave homeless then to try to work with me.

Loss mitigation and customer service
I was noticed that my mortgage was behind and filed the paperwork necessary for a loan modification in XXXX. It is now XXXX  and I am facing foreclosure and am still waiting on paperwork.

I have been in near constant contact with them to no avail. They keep asking for more paperwork, which I send, no no avail. I have sent the same bank statement three times and have uploaded 22 documents since XXXX XXXX and no one has read them or worked on them.

I wrote to the Senior leadership of the company and have received no replies. They are conducting deceptive business practices. I am so frustrated and at my wits end. Ive been working with them in good faith from the start and have been met instead with stonewalling. The lack of customer service is appalling.

I can only hope this is resolved quickly.

Mortgage loan #[protected] assumption of loan
My name is XXXX XXXX since XXXX XXXX  I have been trying to buy a house from your bank. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX). At first, it was a short sale and I made an offer that you didn't accept. After that, I offered to pay the whole amount that the owner XXXX XXXX  owed. Every time you asked for different documents and send the request thru US postal office instead of using Emails that are much faster. I think you should update your process to the 21st century. That made the process very slow and a year passed. Because nothing was happening we decided to do an assumption of loan from the owner and you provided the documents to go that route which I filled and sent to the address provided by your institution and via Email. After that, I called to verify that they receive all the documents and make sure that you had everything that you needed to get the process done. I was told that they had everything they needed and that the process was getting done and that someone was going to give me a call back to get me more details. I'm still waiting for that call. I have called several times and never gotten a callback. I'm amazed that it has been a year and a half and still nothing has happened. I'm still willing to work with you guys to make this happen.
Desired outcome: All I want is to buy the house and someone to contact me so we can discuss the status and finish this process as soon as possible. My cellphone is [protected] or [protected]XXXX.

Refund
Dovenmuehle Mortgage is the absolute worst company.

They owe me a refund that they sent me a letter about in XXXX Ever since I am calling and emailing to see if they can give me that money back.

It has been a nightmare to get any answers out of them.

They keep inventing new things why i need to ""wait longer"" and if I email their departments, nobody ever responds. I am convinved they are a criminal company and that they just keep the money they owe people. On top of everything there are so many bad reviews and complaints online and yet they pretend to have A+ ratings on their website! Beware of this company people! I will look into legal action. This is terrible and somebody has to look into these practices before people lose their houses.
Desired outcome: REFUND of my property!

"Payday loan, title loan, personal loan, or advance loan",Problem when making payments,None,"In XXXX, 2024, an unauthorized device accessed my XXXX XXXX  checking account, and I notified the bank. XXXX XXXX  investigated the incident and flagged multiple transactions for potentially fraudulent activity. Among the transactions the bank flagged for fraud were three payments to my CreditFresh  line of credit, in the amounts of {$500.00}, {$510.00}, and {$700.00}. On XX/XX/year>, XXXX XXXX  initiated chargebacks on the transactions without my knowledge. These were legitimate payments that I had made to my line of credit, so upon learning of the chargebacks I contacted XXXX XXXX  's claims department to reverse the chargebacks and return the funds to CreditFresh. I called and emailed CreditFresh, keeping them informed of the situation as I did not want to incur any penalties on my credit line. They assured me that once the chargebacks were reversed, all would be well. 

At the time, my outstanding principal balance with CreditFresh was {$1100.00}, with an available credit amount of {$1000.00}. I made two additional payments to CreditFresh in the amounts of {$380.00} on XX/XX/year>, and {$96.00} on XX/XX/year>. On the day of my last payment, XX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my CreditFresh account was in default for a balance of {$2400.00} and that payment was due immediately. 

I contacted CreditFresh to see why my account had been defaulted, and was told that no payments had been received and the chargebacks from XXXX XXXX  had not been reversed. I contacted XXXX XXXX, and was told that the chargebacks had indeed been reversed, that all investigation into those transactions had been closed as requested, and my other payments had been processed and sent to CreditFresh. XXXX XXXX  provided ARNs that I sent to CreditFresh so they could verify these payments. 

CreditFresh continued to deny that payment had been received, and insisted that I owed a balance of {$2400.00}. They ignored the ARNs I sent them and did not give any indication that they had tried to verify the transactions. They told me that XXXX XXXX  had taken the money back, and that I needed to pay them immediately. I went back to the bank and was told the same as before, that all three chargebacks were reversed and sent to CreditFresh, and my other payments had been made successfully. The bank told me that this information was readily apparent from my bank statements, but called the XXXX claims department again anyway to reconfirm. 

I contacted CreditFresh again to see if they could use the ARNs to verify receipt of the payments, but they ignored this suggestion and demanded payment in full. I checked my account on the CreditFresh website, and none of the payments were listed in my account activity. In several phone calls and emails that followed, I asked them to provide the payment history for my account, and a validation of debt document. I have asked for these documents multiple times since XXXX, and have yet to receive anything. I continued contacting the company, suggesting on multiple occasions that they should speak to XXXX XXXX  to see what happened. They were not interested, and demanded that I repay the full balance immediately. I told them that I would be happy to facilitate a phone conversation between CreditFresh, myself, and XXXX XXXX  so that we could get to the bottom of this, but CreditFresh refused. 

On XX/XX/year>, I reported this to the XXXX XXXX XXXX in hopes that they could help me resolve the issue with CreditFresh. I supplied my written account and provided all relevant documents from XXXX XXXX  and my CreditFresh account, along with copies of my email correspondence with CreditFresh. I received a reply from CreditFresh through the BBB, who changed their story to claim that the initial chargebacks were in fact reversed, but a second round of chargebacks was initiated by XXXX XXXX  in XXXX and the funds were all returned to my checking account. They sent "" receipts '' for these alleged chargebacks to my email. This claim was not supported by my bank statements, as no such transactions existed, but I asked XXXX XXXX  to look into it anyway. I was informed by XXXX XXXX  's claims department that no second round of chargebacks was ever initiated, and that the three chargebacks from XX/XX/year> had long since been returned to CreditFresh. I visited my local branch office to show a banker the "" receipts '' sent by CreditFresh, and was told that no such transactions had ever occurred and these "" receipts '' were invalid. I asked the the banker what other evidence I could provide to CreditFresh that these payments were sent, and was told that I had already given them more than they should need. I reported all this to the XXXX, to which CreditFresh did not provide any meaningful response ; they simply replied "" refer to our previous email. '' I have done everything I can think of to resolve this situation amicably, but CreditFresh still refuses to speak with XXXX XXXX  or entertain the notion of verifying the ARNs I provided them. They continue to report a defaulted account which they threaten will be sent to collections ; this is both false and damaging to my credit profile. Despite my efforts, CreditFresh does not seem interested in working with me to rectify the situation. According to XXXX XXXX, all transactions in question have been paid to CreditFresh, yet they still insist that I must pay them again."

The sticker price was {$62000.00}. Within XXXX weeks, I started experiencing issues with the car. While driving the car, it completely shut off. I was forced to turn down a street and use my emergency brake as the brakes did not work. When I brought it to the dealership, I was told that nothing was wrong with the car. In XXXX, I got a letter in the mail stating that there was a recall for an electrical issue. The dealership denied any wrongdoing As the weather turned colder ( Fall/Winter XXXX ) the electric mode started to fail so it was only allowing gas use. After many more back-and-forth trips to the dealership, I was eventually told that the electric mode simply does not work when it is cold out. I tried to go through XXXX XXXX who offered trade assistance to get out of the car. I was then told that there was over $ XXXX in negative equity just after 6 months of owning the car. Needless to say, I did not go that route. 

The car worked ok during the summer but around XX/XX/XXXX the car 's electric mode failed again. To make things worse, the car felt like it was "" bucking '' and not running correctly. Again, after much back and forth from the dealership, I was told that nothing could be done unless a check engine light came on. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, the check engine light did come on and through diagnostics, I was told that it was going to cost {$25000.00} to fix the vehicle. Although this is covered under warranty, I continue to have concerns over the safety of the vehicle, given the history of issues experienced. I once again requested that I be let out of my lease but they forced me to take the car back. After driving it off the lot, I noticed that the electric mode still did not work but I was told that the $ XXXX repairs did not address that issue. I attached the response from the dealership. 

I tried once again over the winter ( XXXX ) to get the car returned but the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX denied my request. 

This summer, the car had various problems such as shaking while going over bumps and the touch screen freezing. I was told that it needed more repairs but they can not provide a loaner. I am still trying to figure out a way to drop it off and still have transportation. 

This XXXX, I received a letter in the mail informing me of a new recall. This time it stated that the car was a potential fire hazard. I have attached the letter to the email. There is currently no fix for this recall and per the letter, I am not to park it near any buildings or other vehicles. I am still expected to make my lease payment. 

I had been working with a Lemon Law Lawyer ( no cost to me ). I was told that XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) had access to my warranty history but upon requesting ( myself and the law firm ) it, we were both told that it would not be released without a subpoena. The lawyer ( XXXX XXXX XXXX has mentioned that it would be a good idea and would help my case if the story was shared.

He said once it posted I could dispute and that we will take care of you, XXXX XXXXXXXX. I see you're a 20-year card holder. Well when it posted, I disputed and they said I was responsible for what turned out to be a $ {$450.00} credit card charge. Their proof was a receipt signed with an "" XXXX  ''.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), I am entitled to accurate and verifiable information on my credit report. I am requesting that this collection account be investigated and removed if it is found to be inaccurate or unverifiable. Disputed Account Details : Collection Agency Name : BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE Date of entry : XX/XX/year> Reason for Dispute : 1. I have not been afforded the opportunity to dispute the account in accordance with 12CFR 1006.34 ( c ) ( 4 ) ( ). This denial of the dispute process deprives me of my right to challenge any inaccuracies or discrepancies regarding the alleged debt. 2. BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE has resorted to false, misleading, and deceptive means in their collection efforts, thereby violating my consumer rights. Such unethical practices undermine the integrity of the debt collection process and cause undue distress to consumers. 3. Furthermore, the agency lacks the authority to furnish any account to consumer reporting agencies without adhering to the necessary disclosures mandated by law. By neglecting to fulfil their obligations under 12 CER 1006.34 ( d ) and 15 USC 1681-S 2 ( 7 ) ( A ). BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE is flagrantly disregarding consumer protection statutes. I demand that CFPB investigate these egregious Legal Basis for Dispute : 1.

The credit bureau is required to investigate the disputed information and ensure that it is accurate and verifiable. If the information can not be verified, it must be removed from my credit report. XXXX. Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : Under Section 809 of the FDCPA, I am entitled to verification of the debt from the collection agency. If the collection agency can not provide proper verification or validation of the debt, it must cease collection efforts and remove the account from my credit report. Request for Action : I request that you investigate this matter and provide me with the results of your investigation. If the collection account is found to be inaccurate or unverifiable, I ask that it be removed from my credit report. Please provide me with written confirmation once the correction has been made.

Verification of compliance : Proof that this debt complies with state and federal statutes, including those related to billing practices for medical services.

Debt collection,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"I WOULD LIKE CFBP TO ATTACH SAME ATTACHMENTS TO THIS COMPLAINT THAT I FILED WITH THE COMPLAINT AGAINST XXXX XXXX TODAY IN THE COMPLAINT XXXX JUST NOW. I WASNT ABLE TO INCLUDE MULTIPLE COMPANIES AS RESPONDENTS IN THAT COMPLAIN SO I AM SUBMITTING THIS ONE FOR DIAZ ANSELMO AND ASSOCIATES.

I have an urgent problem related to what I owe in federal and State of Florida taxes in connection to my mortgage debt, and to a lack of understanding what interest rates I was charged on my mortgage loan. I don't know what amount I owe and to which government agency, even though I am now in a second lawsuit regarding this matter. Please help me getting this information... I tried at least 12 times -using a variety of communication methods such as certified mail, phone conversation, email, and court- to obtain this information from : 1. The lender XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX. The servicer XXXX XXXX. XXXX. The debt collector Diaz Anselmo & Associates PA ( XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ). XXXX. IRS. XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Florida Department of Revenue. All of these attempts were unsuccessful. I have been trying for a whole year. If I do not get this information in next couple weeks, I can be accused of a federal bankruptcy fraud crime. Here is what happened : 1. I wanted to sell my condo when I became ill and was 6 weeks behind in my mortgage payments. I asked my ex-husband to help. 2. My ex looked at my loan applications which were submitted on my behalf by my landlord at a time ( who has been a long time condo board member and licensed realtor ). He discovered that my condo address was changed during the loan origination by the seller entering a new building number for my condo. My title report was forged and it was not shown that there is a mortgage on whole building and land, and open mortgage from the former owner on the condo unit which I was buying in the building. My ex told me that government can forfeit my condo because false info was submitted to bank. XXXX. I notified the mortgage servicer on XX/XX/XXXX about the fraud and sent evidence of fraudulent loan applications and changed property address. XXXX. Mortgage servicer, instead of putting me in a nonmonetary default for fraud in the borrower 's application, as it is required in my mortgage contract, waited until I am eligible for a monetary default for failure to make mortgage payments, and started the foreclosure proceedings then. 5. Three days after the foreclosure complaint was filed in XXXX XXXX XXXX court on XXXX XXXX, my condo was sold to the condominium XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Our condominium operates as a special purpose entity due to being a historic-contributing property in XXXX XXXX XXXX Every time there is a sale, it is first sold to condominium, and the condominium sells the condo to a new owner. This is a double escrow scheme where a separate deed with the county recorder is not recorded at a time the condo is sold to the condominium. Condominium doesn't pay state or federal taxes due to being part of conservation easement syndicate in XXXX XXXX and the sale taking place with the help of the infinite banking insurance entity XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX. XXXX XXXX secured the summary judgement from the court and scheduled the sale of my condo on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX. The summary judgement order was written by XXXX XXXX lawyers Diaz Anselmo & Associates as it was ordered by the judge for them to upload the order into the court system. The summary judgement order changed the contract terms where the interest rate was changed and times when those interest rates were charged were also changed. Diaz Anselmo & Associates filed three different summary judgement orders with different amounts showing as owed. 8. Under Florida law, both the lender and the borrower are liable for the unpaid taxes. I wrote to IRS and Florida Department of Revenue asking to clarify what I owe but have not heard back. 9. I didnt receive the tax forms from the mortgage servicer for the year of XXXX. So I am not sure if IRS was paid for the mortgage interest income. XXXX. I filed a bankruptcy petition with the XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Court. But I have no idea what I owe to XXXX XXXX and to IRS and the Department of Revenue because there are at least XXXX different versions filed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the public records. XXXX. I called and wrote to XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and Diaz Anselmo & Associates many many times, asking for - 1.Explanation on which dates which interest rate was charged. 2.Title Search Report. 3.Evidence that IRS taxes were paid for interest charged in XXXX. 4.Proof the documentary taxes were paid to Department of Revenue. 5.Proof the court cost taxes were paid. 6. Explanation why the lawyers filed another document in court for over XXXX dol in legal costs 2 months after the final judgement was entered when the case was closed and there were no legal actions being taken such as appeal or rehearing. I was a pro se litigant in my foreclosure case. Tomorrow is my first hearing in bankruptcy court and I am scared the judge will accuse me of bankruptcy crime when they see that my petition has inaccurate numbers on mortgage and taxes debt, and all because XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ignored my begging to provide clarification... help..."
Debt collection,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was paid,"I engaged XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  for debt resolution and Rausch Sturm representing XXXX XXXX was one of the accounts and they did not engage them causing a judgment against me and garnishment which is paid. XXXX XXXX failed to provide a revocation letter to Rausch Sturm after my many attempts to call and sent emails and Rausch Sturm will not provide proof that it is settled without a revocation letter.
